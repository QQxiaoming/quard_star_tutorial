This document describes an extension to
the X11 server.  The purpose of this extension is to support the use
of additional input devices beyond the pointer and keyboard devices
defined by the core X protocol.  This first section gives an overview
of the input extension.  The following sections correspond to 
chapters 9, 10, and 11, ``Window and Session Manager Functions'',
``Events'', and ``Event Handling Functions'' of the
``Xlib - C Language Interface'' manual
and describe how to use the input device extension.
</para>

<title>Design Approach</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Design Approach -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The design approach of the extension is to define functions
and events analogous to the core functions and events.
This allows extension input devices and events to be individually
distinguishable from each other and from the core input devices and events.
These functions and events make use of a device identifier and support the
reporting of <emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis>-dimensional motion data as well as other data that
is not currently reportable via the core input events.

<!-- .LP -->
The X server core protocol supports two input devices:  a pointer and a
keyboard.  The pointer device has two major functions. 
First, it may be used to generate motion information
that client programs can detect. Second, it may also be used to indicate the
current location and focus of the X keyboard.  To accomplish this, the server 
echoes a cursor at the current position of the X pointer.  Unless the X
keyboard has been explicitly focused, this cursor also shows the current
location and focus of the X keyboard.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The X keyboard is used to generate input that client programs can detect.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The X keyboard and X pointer are referred to in this document as 
the <emphasis remap='I'>core devices</emphasis>, and the input
events they generate 
<function>( KeyPress ,</function>
<function>KeyRelease ,</function>
<function>ButtonPress ,</function>
<function>ButtonRelease ,</function>
and
<function>MotionNotify )</function>
are known as the <emphasis remap='I'>core input events</emphasis>.  All other
input devices are referred to as <emphasis remap='I'>extension input devices</emphasis>, and the 
input events they generate are referred to as <emphasis remap='I'>extension input events</emphasis>.
<!-- .NT -->
This input extension does not change the behavior or functionality of the
core input devices, core events, or core protocol requests, with the
exception of the core grab requests.  These requests may affect the
synchronization of events from extension devices.  See the explanation
in the section titled ``Event Synchronization and Core Grabs.''
<!-- .NE -->
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Selection of the physical devices to be initially used by the server as the 
core devices is left implementation dependent.  Functions are defined that
allow client programs to change which physical devices are used as the
core devices.

<title>Extension Input Devices</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Extension Input Devices -->

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The input extension controls access to input devices other than the X keyboard
and X pointer.  It allows client programs to select input from these devices 
independently
from each other and independently from the core devices.  Input events from
these devices are of extension types 
<function>( DeviceKeyPress ,</function>
<function>DeviceKeyRelease ,</function>
<function>DeviceButtonPress ,</function>
<function>DeviceButtonRelease ,</function>
<function>DeviceMotionNotify ,</function>
and so on) and contain
a device identifier so that events of the same type coming from different
input devices can be distinguished.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Extension input events are not limited in size by the size of the server
32-byte wire events.  Extension input events
may be constructed by the server sending as many
wire-sized events as necessary to return the information required for
that event.
The library event reformatting routines
are responsible for combining these into one or more client XEvents.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Any input device that generates key, button, or motion data may be used as
an extension input device.
Extension input devices may have zero or more keys, zero or more buttons,
and may report zero or more axes of motion.  Motion may be reported 
as relative movements from a previous position or as an absolute
position.  All valuators reporting motion information for a given
extension input device must report the same kind of motion information
(absolute or relative).
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
This extension is designed to accommodate new types of input devices that
may be added in the future.  The protocol requests that refer to
specific characteristics of input devices organize that information
by <emphasis remap='I'>input device classes</emphasis>.  Server implementors may add new
classes of input devices without changing the protocol requests.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
All extension input
devices are treated like the core X keyboard in determining their location
and focus.  The server does not track the location of these devices on an
individual basis and, therefore,
does not echo a cursor to indicate their current location.
Instead, their location is determined by the location of the core X pointer.
Like the core X keyboard, some may be explicitly focused. If they are
not explicitly focused,  their focus
is determined by the location of the core X pointer.
</para>
<sect3 id="Input_Device_Classes">

<!-- .XS -->

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Some of the input extension requests divide input devices into classes
based on their functionality.  This is intended to allow new classes of input
devices to be defined at a later time without changing the semantics of 
these functions.  The following input device classes are currently
defined:

</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Additional classes may be added in the future.
Functions that support multiple input classes, such as the 
<xref linkend='XListInputDevices' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
function that lists all available input devices,
organize the data they return by input class.  Client programs that
use these functions should not access data unless it matches a 
class defined at the time those clients were compiled.  In this way,
new classes can be added without forcing existing clients that use
these functions to be recompiled.

Using these functions may change the characteristics of the core devices.
The new pointer device may have a different number of buttons from the 
old one, or the new keyboard device may have a different number of
keys or report a different range of keycodes.  Client programs may be
running that depend on those characteristics.  For example, a client
program could allocate an array based on the number of buttons on the
pointer device and then use the button numbers received in button events
as indices into that array.  Changing the core devices could cause
such client programs to behave improperly or to terminate abnormally
if they ignore the 
<function>ChangeDeviceNotify</function>
event generated by these requests.

all input events from this device will be discarded until a new focus window

If the focus argument is a window ID, it becomes the focus

The acceleration, expressed as a fraction, is a multiplier for movement. 
For example,
specifying 3/1 means that the device moves three times as fast as normal.
The fraction may be rounded arbitrarily by the X server.  
Acceleration takes effect only if the device moves more than threshold pixels at
once and applies only to the amount beyond the value in the threshold argument.
Setting a value to -1 restores the default.
The values of the accelNumerator and threshold fields must be nonzero for
the pointer values to be set.
Otherwise, the parameters will be unchanged.
Negative values generate a
<function>BadValue</function>
error, as does a zero value
for the accelDenominator field.

Event types are integer numbers that a client can use to determine what
kind of event it has received.  The client compares the type field of 
the event structure with known event types to make this determination.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The core input event types are constants and are defined in the header file
<function>&lt; X11/X.h &gt;.</function>
Extension event types are not constants.  Instead, they
are dynamically allocated by the extension's request to the X server
when the extension is initialized.  Because of this, extension event
types must be obtained by the client from the server.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The client program determines the event type for an extension event by using
the information returned by the
<xref linkend='XOpenDevice' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
request.
This type can then be used for comparison with the type field
of events received by the client.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Extension events propagate up the window hierarchy in the same manner
as core events.  If a window is not interested in an extension event, 
it usually propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the dont_propagate list prohibits it.
Grabs of extension devices may alter the set of windows that receive a particular
extension event.

Event classes are integer numbers that are used in the same way as the
core event masks.  They are used by a client program to indicate to the
server which events that client program wishes to receive.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The core input event masks are constants and are defined in the header file
<function>&lt; X11/X.h &gt;.</function>
Extension event classes are not constants.  Instead, they are dynamically
allocated by the extension's request to the X server
when the extension is initialized.  Because of this, extension event
classes must be obtained by the client from the server.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The event class for an extension event and device is obtained from
information returned by the 
<xref linkend='XOpenDevice' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
function. 
This class can then be used in an
<xref linkend='XSelectExtensionEvent' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
request to ask that events of that type from that device be sent to
the client program.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
For
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
events, the client may specify whether
or not an implicit passive grab should be done when the button is
pressed.  If the client wants to guarantee that it will receive a
<function>DeviceButtonRelease</function>
event for each
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
event it receives, it should specify the
<function>DeviceButtonPressGrab</function>
class in addition to the
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
class.
This restricts the client in that only one client at a time
may request
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
events from the same device and
window if any client specifies this class.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
If any client has specified the
<function>DeviceButtonPressGrab</function>
class, any requests by any other client that specify the same device
and window and specify either
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
or
<function>DeviceButtonPressGrab</function>
will cause an
<function>Access</function>
error to be generated.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
If only the
<function>DeviceButtonPress</function>
class is specified, no implicit passive grab will be done when a button
is pressed on the device.
Multiple clients may use this class to specify the same device and
window combination.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The client may also select
<function>DeviceMotion</function>
events only when a button is down.
It does this by specifying the event classes 
<function>DeviceButton1Motion</function>
through
<function>DeviceButton5Motion .  </function>
An input device will support only
as many button motion classes as it has buttons.

Extension events propagate up the window hierarchy in the same manner
as core events.  If a window is not interested in an extension event, 
it usually propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the dont_propagate list prohibits it.
Grabs of extension devices may alter the set of windows that receive a 
particular extension event.
