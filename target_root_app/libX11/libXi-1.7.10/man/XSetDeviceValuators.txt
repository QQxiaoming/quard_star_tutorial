=================================

NAME
----

   XSetDeviceValuators - initialize the valuators on an extension input device

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   XSetDeviceValuators( Display *display,
                        XDevice *device,
                        int *valuators,
                        int first_valuator,
                        int num_valuators);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device whose valuators are to be
          initialized.

   valuators
          Specifies a pointer to an array of integer values to be
          used to initialize the device valuators.

   first_valuator
          Specifies the first valuator to be set. Valuators are
          numbered beginning with zero.

   num_valuators
          Specifies the number of valuators to be set.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XSetDeviceValuators request sets the current values of the
   valuators of an input device. The valuators in the range
   first_valuator to (first_valuator + num_valuators) are set to
   the specified values. Valuators are numbered beginning with 0.
   Not all input devices support initialization of valuator
   values. If this request is made to a device that does not
   support valuators initialization, a BadMatch error will occur.

   If the request succeeds, a status of Success is returned. If
   another client has the device grabbed, a status of
   AlreadyGrabbed is returned.

   XSetDeviceValuators can generate a BadLength, BadDevice,
   BadMatch, or BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XSetDeviceValuators request
          is made specifying a device that has no valuators and
          reports no axes of motion, or if such a request is made
          specifying a device that does not support valuator
          initialization.

   BadValue
          An invalid first_valuator or num_valuators values was
          specified.
