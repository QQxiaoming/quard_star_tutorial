SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   int XGrabDeviceKey( Display *display,
                       XDevice *device,
                       unsigned int key,
                       unsigned int modifiers,
                       XDevice *modifier_device,

                       Bool owner_events,
                       unsigned int event_count,
                       XEventClass *event_list,
                       int this_device_mode,
                       int other_devices_mode);

   int XUngrabDeviceKey( Display *display,
                         XDevice *device,
                         unsigned int key,
                         unsigned int modifiers,
                         XDevice *modifier_device,
                         Window grab_window);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or released.

   Key
          Specifies the device Key that is to be grabbed released
          or AnyKey.

   modifiers
          Specifies the set of keymasks or AnyModifier.The mask is
          the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.Valid
          bits are: ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask,
          Mod2Mask,Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask.

   modifier_device
          Specifies the device whose modifiers are to be used. If
          a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard
          will be used as the modifier_device.

   grab_window
          Specifies the grab window.

   owner_events
          Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the
          device events are to be reported as usual or reported
          with respect to the grab window if selected by the event
          list.

   event_count
          Specifies the number of event classes in the event list.

   event_list
          Specifies which device events are reported to the
          client.

   this_device_mode
          Specifies further processing of events from this
          device. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

   other_devices_mode
          Specifies further processing of events from other
          devices. You can pass GrabModeSyncor GrabModeAsync.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XGrabDeviceKey request establishes a passive grab. In the
   future, the device is actively grabbed (as for XGrabDevice, the
   last-device-grab time is set to the time at which the Key was
   pressed (as transmitted in the DeviceKeyPress event), and the
   DeviceKeyPress event is reported if all of the following
   conditions are true:
     * The device is not grabbed, and the specified key is
       logically pressed when the specified modifier keys are
       logically down, and no other keys or modifier keys are
       logically down.
     * The grab_window is an ancestor (or is) the focus window OR
       the grab window is a descendant of the focus window and
       contains the device.
     * The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.
     * A passive grab on the same key/modifier combination does
       not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.

   The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
   XGrabDevice. The active grab is terminated automatically when
   the logical state of the device has the specified key released.

   Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of
   the X protocol ) may lag the physical state if device event
   processing is frozen.

   If the key is not AnyKey, it must be in the range specified by
   min_keycode and max_keycode as returned by the
   XListInputDevices request. Otherwise, a BadValue error results.

   This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on
   the same Key/modifier combinations on the same window. A
   modifier of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the grab
   request for all possible modifier combinations (including the
   combination of no modifiers). It is not required that all
   modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes. A key of
   AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible
   keys. Otherwise, it is not required that the specified key
   currently be assigned to a physical Key.

   If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will
   be used as the modifier_device.

   If some other client has already issued a XGrabDeviceKey with
   the same Key/modifier combination on the same window, a
   BadAccess error results. When using AnyModifier or AnyKey, the
   request fails completely, and a BadAccess error results (no
   grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab for any
   combination.XGrabDeviceKey has no effect on an active grab.

   XGrabDeviceKey can generate BadAccess, BadClass, BadDevice,
   BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors. It returns Success on
   successful completion of the request.

   The XUngrabDeviceKey request releases the passive grab for a
   key/modifier combination on the specified window if it was
   grabbed by this client. A modifier of AnyModifier is equivalent
   to issuing the ungrab request for all possible modifier
   combinations, including the combination of no modifiers. A Key
   of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible
   Keys.XUngrabDeviceKey has no effect on an active grab.

   If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will
   be used as the modifier_device.

   XUngrabDeviceKey can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue and
   BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
          specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XGrabDeviceKey request was
          made specifying a device that has no keys, or a modifier
          device that has no keys.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          Window.
