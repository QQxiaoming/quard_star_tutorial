   XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList, XGetDeviceDontPropagateList -
   query or change the dont-propagate-list for extension devices

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   int XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList( Display *display,
                                       Window window,
                                       int count,
                                       XEventClass *event_list,
                                       int mode);

   XEventClass* XGetDeviceDontPropagateList( Display *display,
                                             Window window,
                                             int *count);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   window
          Specifies the window whose dont-propagate-list is to be
          queried or modified.

   event_list
          Specifies a pointer to a list of event classes.

   mode
          Specifies the mode. You can pass AddToList, or
          DeleteFromList.

   count
          Specifies the number of event classes in the list.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList request modifies the list of
   events that should not be propagated to ancestors of the event
   window. This request allows extension events to be added to or
   deleted from that list. By default, all events are propagated
   to ancestor windows. Once modified, the list remains modified
   for the life of the window. Events are not removed from the
   list because the client that added them has terminated.

   Suppression of event propagation is not allowed for all input
   extension events. If a specified event class is one that cannot
   be suppressed, a BadClass error will result. Events that can be
   suppressed include DeviceKeyPress, DeviceKeyRelease,
   DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelease, DeviceMotionNotify,
   ProximityIn, and ProximityOut.

   XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadDevice,
   BadClass, or BadValue error.

   The XGetDeviceDontPropagateList request queries the list of
   events that should not be propagated to ancestors of the event
   window.

   XGetDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadClass or
   BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
          other client has caused the specified device to become
          the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
          XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.

   BadWindow
          An invalid window id was specified.

   BadClass
          An invalid event class was specified.
