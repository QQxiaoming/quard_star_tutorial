<chapter id='Overview_of_Session_Management'>
  <title>Overview of Session Management</title>

  <abstract>
    <para>
The purpose of the X Session Management Protocol (<acronym>XSMP</acronym>)
is to provide a uniform mechanism for users to save and restore their
sessions.  A <firstterm>session</firstterm> is a group of clients,
each of which has a particular state.  The session is controlled by a
network service called the <firstterm>session manager</firstterm>.
The session manager issues commands to its clients on behalf of the
user.  These commands may cause clients to save their state or to
terminate.  It is expected that the client will save its state in such
a way that the client can be restarted at a later time and resume its
operation as if it had never been terminated.  A client's state might
include information about the file currently being edited, the current
position of the insertion point within the file, or the start of an
uncommitted transaction.  The means by which clients are restarted is
unspecified by this protocol.
    </para>

    <para>
For purposes of this protocol, a <firstterm>client</firstterm> of the
session manager is defined as a connection to the session manager.  A
client is typically, though not necessarily, a process running an
application program connected to an X display.  However, a client may
be connected to more than one X display or not be connected to any X
displays at all.
    </para>
  </abstract>
</chapter>

<chapter id='The_Session_Management_Library'>
  <title>The Session Management Library</title>
  <abstract>
    <para>
The Session Management Library (<abbrev>SMlib</abbrev>) is a low-level
"C" language interface to XSMP.  It is expected that higher level
toolkits, such as Xt, will hide many of the details of session
management from clients.  Higher level toolkits might also be developed
for session managers to use, but no such effort is currently under way.
    </para>
  </abstract>

  <para>
    SMlib has two parts to it:
    <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
      <listitem><para>One set of functions for clients that want to be part of a session</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>One set of functions for session managers to call</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
Some applications will use both sets of functions and act as
<firstterm>nested session managers</firstterm>.  That is, they will be
both a session manager and a client of another session.  An example is
a mail program that could start a text editor for editing the text of
a mail message.  The mail program is part of a regular session and, at
the same time, is also acting as a session manager to the editor.
  </para>

  <para>
Clients initialize by connecting to the session manager and obtaining
a <firstterm>client-ID</firstterm> that uniquely identifies them in
the session.  The session manager maintains a list of properties for
each client in the session.  These properties describe the client's
environment and, most importantly, describe how the client can be
restarted (via an <property>SmRestartCommand</property>). Clients are
expected to save their state in such a way as to allow multiple
instantiations of themselves to be managed independently.  For
example, clients may use their client-ID as part of a filename in
which to store the state for a particular instantiation.  The
client-ID should be saved as part of the <property>SmRestartCommand</property>
so that the client will retain the same ID after it is restarted.
  </para>

  <para>
Once the client initializes itself with the session manager, it must
be ready to respond to messages from the session manager.  For
example, it might be asked to save its state or to terminate.  In the
case of a shutdown, the session manager might give each client a
chance to interact with the user and cancel the shutdown.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id='Understanding_SMlibs_Dependence_on_ICE'>
  <title>Understanding SMlib's Dependence on ICE</title>

  <para>
The X Session Management Protocol is layered on top of the
Inter-Client Exchange (<acronym>ICE</acronym>) Protocol.  The ICE
protocol is designed to multiplex several protocols over a single
connection.  As a result, working with SMlib requires a little
knowledge of how the ICE library works.
  </para>

  <para>
The ICE library utilizes callbacks to process messages.  When a client
detects that there is data to read on an ICE connection, it should
call the <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceProcessMessages'><function>IceProcessMessages</function></olink> function.
<olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceProcessMessages'><function>IceProcessMessages</function></olink> will read the message header
and look at the major opcode in order to determine which protocol the
message was intended for.  The appropriate protocol library will then
be triggered to unpack the message and hand it off to the client via a
callback.
  </para>

  <para>
The main point to be aware of is that an application using SMlib must
have some code that detects when there is data to read on an ICE
connection.  This can be done via a <function>select</function> call
on the file descriptor for the ICE connection, but more
typically, <function>XtAppAddInput</function> will be used to register
a callback that will invoke <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceProcessMessages'><function>IceProcessMessages</function></olink>
each time there is data to read on the ICE connection.
  </para>

  <para>
To further complicate things, knowing which file descriptors to
call <function>select</function> on requires an understanding of how
ICE connections are created.  On the client side, a call must be made
to <xref linkend='SmcOpenConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/> in order to open a connection
with a session manager.  <xref linkend='SmcOpenConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/> will
internally makea call into <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceOpenConnection'><function>IceOpenConnection</function></olink>
which will, in turn, determine if an ICE connection already exists
between the client and session manager.  Most likely, a connection
will not already exist and a new ICE connection will be created.  The
main point to be aware of is that, on the client side, it is not
obvious when ICE connections get created or destroyed, because
connections are shared when possible.  To deal with this, the ICE
library lets the application register watch procedures that will be
invoked each time an ICE connection is opened or closed.  These watch
procedures could be used to add or remove ICE file descriptors from
the list of descriptors to call <function>select</function> on.
  </para>

  <para>
On the session manager side, things work a bit differently.  The
session manager has complete control over the creation of ICE
connections.  The session manager has to first
call <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceListenForConnections'><function>IceListenForConnections</function></olink> in order to start
listening for connections from clients.  Once a connection attempt is
detected, <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceAcceptConnection'><function>IceAcceptConnection</function></olink> must be called, and
the session manager can simply add the new ICE file descriptor to the
list of descriptors to call <function>select</function> on.

  </para>

  <para>
For further information on the library functions related to ICE connections,
see the <citetitle pubwork='article'>Inter-Client Exchange Library</citetitle>
standard.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id='Header_Files_and_Library_Name'>
<title>Header Files and Library Name</title>

  <para>
Applications (both session managers and clients) should include the
header file &lt;<filename class='headerfile'>X11/SM/SMlib.h</filename>&gt;.
This header file defines all of the SMlib data structures and function
prototypes.  <filename class='headerfile'>SMlib.h</filename> includes the
header file &lt;<filename class='headerfile'>X11/SM/SM.h</filename>&gt;,
which defines all of the SMlib constants.
  </para>

  <para>
Because SMlib is dependent on ICE, applications should link against
SMlib and ICElib by using
<quote><option>-lSM</option> <option>-lICE</option></quote>.

  </tgroup>
</informaltable>
    </para>

    <para>
An attempt will be made to use the first network ID.  If that fails,
an attempt will be made using the second network ID, and so on.
    </para>

    <para>
After the connection is established, <xref linkend='SmcOpenConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
registers the client with the session manager.  If the client is being
restarted from a previous session, <parameter>previous_id</parameter>
should contain a null terminated string representing the client ID from the
previous session.  If the client is first joining the session,
<parameter>previous_id</parameter> should be set to <constant>NULL</constant>.
If <parameter>previous_id</parameter> is specified but is determined
to be invalid by the session manager, SMlib will re-register the
client with <parameter>previous_id</parameter> set to <constant>NULL</constant>.
    </para>

    <para>
If <xref linkend='SmcOpenConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/> succeeds, it returns an
opaque connection pointer of type <function>SmcConn</function> and the
<parameter>client_id_ret</parameter> argument contains the client ID to be
used for this session.  The <parameter>client_id_ret</parameter> should be
freed with a call to <function>free</function> when no longer needed.  On
failure, <xref linkend='SmcOpenConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/> returns
<constant>NULL</constant>, and the reason for failure is returned in
<parameter>error_string_ret</parameter>.
    </para>

    <para>
Note that SMlib uses the ICE protocol to establish a connection with
the session manager.  If an ICE connection already exists between the
client and session manager, it might be possible for the same ICE
connection to be used for session management.
    </para>

    <para id='context_sharing'>
The context argument indicates how willing the client is to share the
ICE connection with other protocols.  If context is <constant>NULL</constant>,
then the caller is always willing to share the connection.  If context is not
<constant>NULL</constant>, then the caller is not willing to use a previously
opened ICE connection that has a different non-<constant>NULL</constant>
context associated with it.
    </para>

    <para>
As previously discussed
(<link linkend='Understanding_SMlibs_Dependence_on_ICE'>section 3,
&ldquo;Understanding SMlib's Dependence on ICE&rdquo;</link>), the
client will have to keep track of when ICE connections are created or
destroyed (using <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceAddConnectionWatch'><function>IceAddConnectionWatch</function></olink>
and <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceRemoveConnectionWatch'><function>IceRemoveConnectionWatch</function></olink> and will have to
call <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceProcessMessages'><function>IceProcessMessages</function></olink> each time
a <function>select</function> shows that there is data to read on an
ICE connection.  For further information, see the
<citetitle pubwork='article'>Inter-Client Exchange Library</citetitle>
standard.
    </para>

    <para>
The callbacks argument contains a set of callbacks used to respond to
session manager events.  The mask argument specifies which callbacks
are set.  All of the callbacks specified in this version of SMlib are
mandatory.  The mask argument is necessary in order to maintain
backwards compatibility in future versions of the library.
    </para>

    <para>
The following values may be ORed together to obtain a
<parameter>mask</parameter> value:

      <simplelist type='vert'>
	<member><constant>SmcSaveYourselfProcMask</constant></member>
	<member><constant>SmcDieProcMask</constant></member>
	<member><constant>SmcSaveCompleteProcMask</constant></member>
	<member><constant>SmcShutdownCancelledProcMask</constant></member>
      </simplelist>
    </para>

    <para>
For each callback, the client can register a pointer to client data.
When SMlib invokes the callback, it will pass the client data pointer.

      <para>
The session manager sends a &ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; message to a
client either to checkpoint it or just before termination so that it
can save its state.  The client responds with zero or more calls
to <xref linkend='SmcSetProperties' xrefstyle='select: title'/> to update the properties
indicating how to restart the client.  When all the properties have
been set, the client calls <xref linkend='SmcSaveYourselfDone' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
      </para>

      <para>
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter> is
<constant>SmInteractStyleNone</constant> the
client must not interact with the user while saving state.
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter> is
<constant>SmInteractStyleErrors</constant> the
client may interact with the user only if an error condition arises.
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter> is
<constant>SmInteractStyleAny</constant> then the
client may interact with the user for any purpose.  Because only one
client can interact with the user at a time, the client must
call <xref linkend='SmcInteractRequest' xrefstyle='select: title'/> and wait for an
&ldquo;Interact&rdquo; message from the session manager.  When the
client is done interacting with the user, it
calls <xref linkend='SmcInteractDone' xrefstyle='select: title'/> The client may only
call <xref linkend='SmcInteractRequest' xrefstyle='select: title'/> after it receives a
&ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; message and before it
calls <xref linkend='SmcSaveYourselfDone' xrefstyle='select: title'/>
      </para>

      <para>
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveLocal</constant> the
client must update the properties to reflect its current state.  Specifically,
it should save enough information to restore the state as seen by the
user of this client.  It should not affect the state as seen by other users.
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveGlobal</constant>
the user wants the client to commit all of its data to permanent, globally
accessible storage.
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveBoth</constant>
the client should do both of these (it should first commit the data to
permanent storage before updating its properties).
      </para>

      <para>
Some examples are as follows:

        <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	  <listitem><para>
If a word processor were sent a &ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; with a
type of <constant>SmSaveLocal</constant> it could create a temporary
file that included the current contents of the file, the location of
the cursor, and other aspects of the current editing session.  It
would then update its <property>SmRestartCommand</property> property with
enough information to find this temporary file.
	  </para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>

If a word processor were sent a &ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; with a
type of <constant>SmSaveBoth</constant> it would first save the

information such as the current position of the cursor and what file
is being edited.  Finally, it would update its
<property>SmRestartCommand</property> property with enough information
to find the temporary file.
	  </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
The <parameter>shutdown</parameter> argument specifies whether the
system is being shut down.
The interaction is different depending on whether or not shutdown is
set.  If not shutting down, the client should save its state and wait
for a &ldquo;Save Complete&rdquo; message.  If shutting down, the
client must save state and then prevent interaction until it receives
either a &ldquo;Die&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Shutdown Cancelled.&rdquo;
      </para>

      <para>
The <parameter>fast</parameter> argument specifies that the client
should save its state as quickly as possible.  For example, if the
session manager knows that power is about to fail, it would
set <parameter>fast</parameter> to <constant>True</constant>.

The session manager sends a &ldquo;Die&rdquo; message to a client when
it wants it to die.  The client should respond by calling
<xref linkend='SmcCloseConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/>.  A session manager that
behaves properly will send a &ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; message

Note that SMlib used the ICE protocol to establish a connection with
the session manager, and various protocols other than session
management may be active on the ICE connection.
When <xref linkend='SmcCloseConnection' xrefstyle='select: title'/> is called, the ICE
connection will be closed only if all protocols have been shutdown on
the connection.  Check the ICElib standard
for <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceAddConnectionWatch'><function>IceAddConnectionWatch</function></olink>
and <olink targetdoc='ICElib' targetptr='IceRemoveConnectionWatch'><function>IceRemoveConnectionWatch</function></olink> to learn how to set
up a callback to be invoked each time an ICE connection is opened or
closed.  Typically this callback adds/removes the ICE file descriptor
from the list of active descriptors to call <function>select</function> on
(or calls <function>XtAppAddInput</function> or
<function>XtRemoveInput</function>).

able to pass client IDs around from machine to machine, from user to
user, and from session manager to session manager, while retaining the
identity of the client.  This, combined with the indefinite
persistence of client IDs, means that client IDs need to be globally

    <para>
The session manager sends a &ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; message to a
client either to checkpoint it or just before termination so that it
can save its state.  The client responds with zero or more &ldquo;Set
Properties&rdquo; messages to update the properties indicating how to
restart the client.  When all the properties have been set, the client
sends a &ldquo;Save Yourself Done&rdquo; message.
    </para>

    <para>
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter>
is <constant>SmInteractStyleNone</constant> the
client must not interact with the user while saving state.
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter>
is <constant>SmInteractStyleErrors</constant> the
client may interact with the user only if an error condition arises.
If <parameter>interact_style</parameter>
is <constant>SmInteractStyleAny</constant> then the
client may interact with the user for any purpose.  The client must
send an &ldquo;Interact Request&rdquo; message and wait for an
&ldquo;Interact&rdquo; message from the session manager before it can
interact with the user.  When the client is done interacting with the
user, it should send an &ldquo;Interact Done&rdquo; message.  The
&ldquo;Interact Request&rdquo; message can be sent any time after a
&ldquo;Save Yourself&rdquo; and before a &ldquo;Save Yourself
Done.&rdquo;
    </para>

    <para>
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveLocal</constant>
the client must update the properties to reflect its current state.
Specifically, it should save enough information to restore the state as
seen by the user of this client.  It should not affect the state as seen
by other users.
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveGlobal</constant>
the user wants the client to commit all of its data to permanent, globally
accessible storage.
If <parameter>save_type</parameter> is <constant>SmSaveBoth</constant>
the client should do both of these (it should first commit the data to
permanent storage before updating its properties).
    </para>

    <para>
The <parameter>shutdown</parameter> argument specifies whether the session
is being shut down.  The interaction is different depending on whether or not
shutdown is set.  If not shutting down, then the client can save and
resume normal operation.  If shutting down, the client must save and
then must prevent interaction until it receives either a
&ldquo;Die&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Shutdown Cancelled,&rdquo; because
anything the user does after the save will be lost.
    </para>

    <para>
The <parameter>fast</parameter> argument specifies that the client should
save its state as quickly as possible.  For example, if the session manager
knows that power is about to fail, it should set <parameter>fast</parameter>
to <constant>True</constant>.

      <para>
The <constant>SmRestartAnyway</constant> style is used to tell the Session

this is only a hint and the Session Manager will follow the policies
specified by its users in determining what applications to restart.

properties to commands that undo the state of the client after it exits.
      </para>

      <para>
The SmRestartImmediately style is like SmRestartAnyway, but, in addition, the client is meant to run continuously.  If the client exits, the Session Manager should try to restart it in the current session.

This command is executed at shutdown time to clean up after a client

<constant>SmRestartAnyway</constant>.  The client must not remove any saved
state as the client is still part of the session.  As an
example, consider a client that turns on a camera at start up time.
This client then exits.  At session shutdown, the user wants the
camera turned off.  This client would set the
<property>SmRestartStyleHint</property> to
<constant>SmRestartAnyway</constant> and would register
a <property>SmShutdownCommand</property> that would turn off the camera.

  <title>Authentication of Clients</title>

  <para>
As stated earlier, the session management protocol is layered on top
of ICE.  Authentication occurs at two levels in the ICE protocol:

<itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
    <listitem><para>The first is when an ICE connection is opened.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>The second is when a Protocol Setup occurs on an ICE connection.</para></listitem>

The authentication methods that are available are
