commit d86106f2369ecf81155decaa360f9162c0c3cd53

    Fixed out ouf boundary accesses.
    
    Out of boundary accesses can occur while processing messages. This
    affects clients and the session server.
    
    Generally, the code tries to prevent out of boundary accesses. It
    initially "skips" over the memory areas by parsing supplied lengths.
    Then, it checks if it skipped over the memory boundary. If not, then
    data is actually read and memory allocated, etc.
    
    The problem is that while initially skipping over the memory,
    subsequent lengths are already parsed, i.e. accessed. This results in
    out of boundary reads on hostile messages.
    
    Lengths could also overflow on 32 bit systems, leading to out of
    boundary writes if not enough bytes have been allocated.
    
    Authentication is handled by libICE, which is not affected, because the
    macros for skipping already take care about memory boundaries.
    
    Therefore, this flaw can only be used by authenticated clients or by
    hostile servers (which could simply accept every MIT cookie). Most
    session managers only use Unix sockets, so in many cases it takes a
    local authenticated user.
    
    In order to fix this, I decided to move the macros from SMlibint.h to
    its only callers in sm_process.c, turning them into functions for much
    easier error handling and readability.
    
    Instead of skipping over the memory, validation happens during actual
    read and memory allocation operations, as it's rather unlikely to
    encounter hostile code anyway, i.e. my code has more error cleanup
    handling in it.

    Documentation: add Docbook external references support
    
    When writing technical documentation, it is often necessary to cross
    reference to other information. When that other information is not in the
    current document, additional support is needed, namely <olink>.
    
    A new feature with version 1.7 of xorg-sgml-doctools adds references to
    other documents within or outside this package.
    
    This patch adds technical support for this feature but does not change
    the content of the documentation as seen by the end user.
    
    Each book or article must generate a database containing the href
    of sections that can be referred to from another document. This database
    is installed in DATAROOTDIR/sgml/X11/dbs. There is a requirement that
    the value of DATAROOTDIR for xorg-sgml-doctools and for the package
    documentation is the same. This forms a virtual document tree.
    
    This database is consulted by other documents while they are being generated
    in order to fulfill the missing information for linking.
    Refer to the xorg-sgml-doctools for further technical information.

    config: comment, minor upgrade, quote and layout configure.ac
    
    Group statements per section as per Autoconf standard layout
    Quote statements where appropriate.
    Autoconf recommends not using dnl instead of # for comments
    
    Use AC_CONFIG_FILES to replace the deprecated AC_OUTPUT with parameters.
    
    This helps automated maintenance and release activities.

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2]). This will prevent the generation
    of the INSTALL file. It is also part of the 24206 solution.

    Use FreeBSD uuid functions when available.
    
    If the system provide the uuid_create function assume building on FreeBSD
    or another OS with a compatible uuid interface. If that's the case, ignore
    libuuid and just use the system functions without extra deps.

    Made handling of DevelDrivers for x86-64 more conformant to other
        platforms.
    Compress all font encodings (Stefan Dirsch).
    Fixed warnings.
    Turn on forwarding XNSpotLocation event to XIM server in OffTheSpot and
        Root mode (bugzilla #1580, James Su).
    Added another compose key combination for the Euro symbol (Stefan Dirsch).
    Added support for UTF-8 in ja_JP, ko_KR and zh_TW locales (Mike Fabian).
    Changed default encoding for ru from KOI8-R to ISO8859-5 (Mike Fabian).
        This is the encoding that is also used by glibc. We may break other
        libcs - lets see who complains.
    Added explanation for DESTDIR to install to a different directory than /.
    Added some early bailouts to atiprobe if PCI structure pointer is NULL to
        prevent sig11.
    XV support doesn't depend on 2D acceleration any more. This patch removes
        this limitation from the NSC driver. This is a patch that I have
        committed to XFree86 a while ago but never ported over to X.Org.
        Matthieu Herrb contributed some build fixes.
    Fixing SetDPMSTimers() so that DPMS*Time == 0 disables the appropriate
        timer. This takes advantage of the fact that TimerSet() with a timeout
        argument 0 behaves like TimerCanel().
    Use /dev/xconsole (named pipe) or devpts for system logger (Werner Fink).
    Create missing links for backward compatibility to XFree86 (Stefan Dirsch).
    Changed comment to mention xorg.
    Changed cursor for the 'kill' action from XC_draped_box to XC_Pirate. If
        you don't like it we can change it back (original author unkown).
    Added 'pic' to the man page rendering command pipeline (Werner Fink).
    Added missing return value (Stefan Dirsch, Roland Mainz)
