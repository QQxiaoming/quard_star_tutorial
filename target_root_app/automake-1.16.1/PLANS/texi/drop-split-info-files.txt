For in Automake 2.0 (DONE)
--------------------------

We will drop split info files in Automake 2.0.
See automake bug#13351: <https://debbugs.gnu.org/13351>.

Basically, it has been confirmed that the original reason behind
the existence of split info files was indeed "efficiency,
especially memory size":
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/texinfo-devel/2012-08/msg00024.html>

So split info files have lost their reason d'etre on modern systems
(where even Emacs has become a lightweight program ;-).  And you are
not using an embedded system to read Info documentation, right?

In addition, it appears that the use of split info files (at least
the way Automake-generated rules have been handling them for a long
time) can cause real problems in some (admittedly quite corner-case)
situations; see automake bug#12320: <https://debbugs.gnu.org/12320>.

This change should be completely transparent to the developer (no
adjustments needed to be made to Makefile.am or other parts of the
build system).  In case some CI system or overly picky build script
used to rely on that feature, they'll have to be adjusted; but that
is expected to be a rare occurrence, and thus a price worth pay for
the nice simplifications and the fixlets this planned change will
offer us.
