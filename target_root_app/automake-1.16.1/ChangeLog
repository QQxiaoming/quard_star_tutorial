	install-sh: avoid (low risk) race in "/tmp"

	Ensure that nobody can cross privilege boundaries by pre-creating
	symlink on '$tmpdir' destination directory.

	Just testing 'mkdir -p' by creating "/tmp/ins$RANDOM-$$/d" is not safe
	because "/tmp" directory is usually world-writeable and
	"/tmp/ins$RANDOM-$$" content could be pretty easily guessed by
	attacker (at least for shells where $RANDOM is not supported).  So, as
	the first step, create the "/tmp/ins$RANDOM-$$" without -p.  This step
	would fail early if somebody wanted catch us.

	Systems that implement (and have enabled) fs.protected_symlinks kernel
	feature are not affected even without this commit.

	python: Support future python version up to 3.9

	This change fixes automake bug#28160.

	Since AM_PYTHON_PATH macro takes no maximum version argument, there is
	no need to generate _AM_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_LIST dynamically, like what
	was previously done by the reverted commit
	1d60fb72168e62d33fe433380af621de64e22f23.  We could rely on M4 to
	generate this list statically however this is likely to be a complex
	solution that would not improve maintainability.

	python: Avoid exceeding command-line length limit

	With Python implementations following PEP-3174, a large number of files
	are installed in the ‘__pycache__’ directory.  As a consequence
	“t/instmany-python.sh” test was failing due to the
	‘uninstall-pythonPYTHON’ target deleting installed files in a single
	‘rm’ command.  Doing that in multiple steps avoids exceeding the
	command-line length limit.  This fixes bug#30335.

	* lib/am/python.am (uninstall-%DIR%PYTHON): For byte-compiled files
	installed in '__pycache__' directory, uninstall them by batch of 40.

	* t/aclocal.sh (am_create_testdir): Don't expect "--versi" to be
	interpreted as "--version".

	The automatic support of newer versions (up to 4.0 excluded) fixes
	bug#28160.

	* m4/python.m4 (am_py_min_ver, am_py_max_ver): New macros.

	port elisp-compilation support to emacs-23.1 and newer

	In May of 2017, emacs.master support for using the long-deprecated
	byte-compile-dest-file function was removed, and that removal broke
	automake's elisp-compiling rule for any .el file not in the current
	directory.  In emacs-23.1 (July 2009) byte-compile-dest-file-function
	became the recommended way to adjust the byte-compiler's destination.
	The removed functionality has been restored for Emacs-26, albeit with
	dissuasive diagnostics warning about the imminent removal of this
	functionality.  It will be removed in Emacs-27.
	* lib/am/lisp.am (.el.elc): Use byte-compile-dest-file-function, rather
	than byte-compile-dest-file.  Also, use "-f batch-byte-compile '$<'"
	rather than open-coding it, as suggested by Glenn Morris.

	Prefer https: URLs

	In Gnulib, Emacs, etc. we are changing ftp: and http: URLs to use

	downstream of, which I'll patch separately.

	Althouth the resources are not secret, plain HTTP is vulnerable to

	'automake' and 'aclocal' without having to install it or knowing the
	existence of "wrapped" scripts in "bin" directory.

	* pre-inst-env.in: New script.
	* configure.ac: Generate 'pre-inst-env' at configure time.
	* Makefile.am (nodist_noinst_SCRIPTS, CLEANFILES): Add it.

	build: Move wrapped scripts in "bin" directory

	Those scripts are used both in the build process and for the tests, so
	it seems clearer to not hide them in "t/wrap" directory.

	* bin/wrap-aclocal.in: ... this.
	* t/wrap/automake.in: Rename to ...
	* bin/wrap-automake.in: ... this.
	* configure.ac: Generate "bin/aclocal-${APIVERSION}" and
	"bin/automake-${APIVERSION}" at configure time.
	* t/Makefile.inc (nodist_noinst_SCRIPTS): Move wrapped scripts ...
	* bin/Makefile.inc (nodist_noinst_SCRIPTS): ... here.

	automake: Shorter object file names under subdir-objects

	Combining the 'subdir-objects' option with target-specific flags had
	the consequence of producing long object file names.  This was done to
	preventively ensure the uniqueness of object file names.  We are now
	using shorter names by default, and handle long names when an actual
	conflict is detected.  This will hopefully reduce the necessity of
	using the 'prog_SHORTNAME' facility.

	Example:
	previously:
	  AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = subdir-objects
	  bin_PROGRAMS += path/to/foo
	  path_to_foo_CFLAGS = $(AM_CFLAGS) -g

	resulted in objects:
	  sub/path_to_foo-foo.o

	now object file name is:
	  sub/foo-foo.o

	* bin/automake.in (proglist, liblist, ltliblist)
	(dup_shortnames): New globals.
	(initialize_per_input): Initialize them.
	(handle_targets): New subroutine.
	(handle_single_transform): Truncate object file names when possible.

	automake: do not emit rule with two dependents

	On a system using our replacement alloca, make would emit
	this warning:
	  target '.deps/alloca.Po' given more than once in the same rule
	That arose because automake would emit a rule depending on both
	./.deps/alloca.Po and .deps/alloca.Po. Normally, duplicate
	dependents are avoided by virtue of their names being keys in
	the %dep_files hash, but in this case, that particular file
	was specified in two different ways.
	* bin/automake.in (handle_ALLOCA): When the $dir prefix is empty,
	make it './', to ensure that when we add ./.deps/alloca.Po
	it is deduped.
	See: http://bugs/gnu/org/22702

2016-06-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	compile: remove .Tpo file upon failure

	When generating a .deps/base.Po file, our emitted rule first writes
	to a temporary .Tpo file, so the final creation can be atomic, via
	mv's rename.  However, when generation of the .Tpo fails, it stop the
	process and does not remove that temporary file.  And nothing else
	ever deletes it, either.  Hence, in the unusual case in which one
	expects a compilation to fail during a successful build (gnulib's
	test-verify.sh does precisely this), a .deps/test-verify.Tpo file
	would be left behind, and that would in turn cause a "make distcheck"
	failure because that file would exist in one build+distclean hierarchy
	but not in the distribution tarball.
	* lib/am/depend2.am: Ensure that the temporary file is removed
	upon failure.
	* t/distcheck-Tpo.sh: New file.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (handwritten_TESTS): Add it.
	This addresses bug#23661.

	deps: fix corner-case "make distclean" bug

	Assume we have package satisfying the following conditions:
	  (1) automatic dependency tracking is enabled;
	  (2) the 'subdir-objects' Automake option is enabled;
	  (3) the package uses a recursive make setup.

	Also assume that:
	  (a) a subdir Makefile declares a foo_SOURCES variable containing
	      a source file in the parent directory;
	  (b) that parent Makefile declare a compiled program itself.

	Then BSD and Solaris make used to fail when running "make distclean",
	because the 'distclean' target of the subdir Makefile removed the
	whole '.deps' directory before the parent Makefile was done with the
	included '.Po' makefile fragments in that directory. This issue was
	revealed by failures in the 'subobj-vpath-pr13928.sh' test when those
	make implementations were used.

	We fix the issue by ensuring the 'distclean' target of any Makefile
	only removed the '.Po' makefile fragments included by it, rather than
	the whole '.deps' directory where such files resides.

	This change should be the last step in fixing automake bug#13928
	for good.

	* bin/automake.in (handle_languages), lib/am/depend.am: Adjust
	to implement the new 'distclean' logic.
	* t/pr224.sh: Adjust to avoid a spurious failure.
	* PLANS/subdir-objects.txt: Update.

2015-01-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	compile: don't place built object files in $(srcdir), ever ...

	... even when a source file is specified as '$(srdir)/foo.c' or
	'$(top_srcdir)/bar.c'. And ditto for dependency-tracking makefile
	fragments (those under '.deps' directories).

	Such issues used to occur when the 'subdir-objects' option was given.

	This change should fix the second and last part of automake bug#13928.
	See also bug#16375 and bug#15293.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* bin/automake.in (handle_single_transform): Make sure object files

	deps: 'subdir-object' option now works when foo_SOURCES contains $(var)

	Following a suggestions of Johan Kristensen, we have config.status use
	'make' invocations rather than Makefile-parsing 'sed' hacks to bootstrap
	the dependency-tracking '.Po' and '.Plo' makefile fragments. To handle
	the inclusion of such files that are still missing when make is first
	we basically generate a temporary Makefile without these includes, and
	call 'make' on that Makefile.

	This fixes the serious bug bug#13928, which was an hard blocker to make the
	behavior mandated by the 'subdir-object' active by default (which we want
	to do in Automake 2.0).

	The issue has also been reported in bug#15919.

	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	* bin/automake.in (handle_languages): Add a trailing "marking" comment
	("# am--include-marker") to the generated Makefile lines issuing 'include'
	directives for the dependency-tracking '.Po' and '.Plo' makefile fragments.
	Also rename the generated Makefile variable 'am__depfiles_maybe' to the
	clearer 'am__maybe_remake_depfiles'.
	Minor unrelated refactoring.
	* lib/am/configure.am: Adjust to account for the 'am__depfiles_maybe' ->
	'am__maybe_remake_depfiles' renaming.
	* lib/am/depend.am: Add rules to generate a dummy version of all the
	dependency-tracking '.Po' and '.Plo' makefile fragments.
	* m4/depout.m4: Use make invocations rather than Makefile-parsing sed hacks
	to bootstrap the dependency-tracking '.Po' and '.Plo' makefile fragments.
	We still use some sed trickery in order to remove the inclusion of the
	still non existing .Po and .Plo files from the Makefile we invoke make
	upon; this is done stripping lines that contain the magic string
	"# am--include-marker".
	* m4/make.m4 (AM_MAKE_INCLUDE): Given that now automake generates Makefiles
	containing include statements with trailing comment, adjust the checks done
	here to make sure $MAKE support that; e.g., "include foo.mk # comment"
	rather than just "include foo.mk".
	Also refactor and adjust to leave better debugging info in config.log.
	* t/postproc.sh: Rename ...
	* t/depend-postproc.sh: ... to this, and adjust and enhance.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (handwritten_TESTS): Adjust.
	(XFAIL_TESTS): Remove 't/subobj-indir-pr13928.sh', which is now succeeding.
	* t/subobj-indir-pr13928.sh: Simplify slightly, now that we expect it to
	pass.
	* t/depcomp8a.sh: Adjust grepping check to account for the changes in
	the generated Makefile, and tp be somewhat more robust in light of possible
	future modifications.

	texinfo: remove hack about info files in CLEANFILES variables

	Automake used to implement an undocumented hack causing '.info' files
	that appeared to be cleaned (by e.g. being listed in the CLEANFILES
	variable) to also be built in the builddir rather than in the srcdir;
	this was for backward compatibility with packages such as Texinfo,
	which did things like:

	    info_TEXINFOS = texinfo.txi info-stnd.texi info.texi
	    DISTCLEANFILES = texinfo texinfo-* info*.info*
	    # Do not create info files for distribution.
	    dist-info:

	in order not to distribute .info files.

	Now that we have the 'info-in-builddir' option that explicitly causes
	generated '.info' files to be placed in the builddir, this hack is no
	longer necessary, and we can remove it (after having deprecated it in
	the Automake 1.14 release already).

	* bin/automake.in (handle_texinfo_helper): Remove the hack.  Adjust
	comments accordingly.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* t/txinfo23.sh: Delete as obsolete.
	* t/txinfo25.sh: Likewise.
	* t/txinfo24.sh: Likewise.

	dist: fix bug#18286 "distcheck fails to detect missing files"

	BTW, this issue had been already reported in the past:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2006-09/msg00008.html
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2013-01/msg00049.html

	"make distcheck" could sometimes fail to detect missing files in the
	distribution tarball, especially in those cases where both the generated
	files and their dependencies are explicitly in $(srcdir).  An important
	example of this are *generated* makefile fragments included at Automake
	time in Makefile.am.  A basic example:

	    # -*- Makefile.am -*-

	    $(srcdir)/fragment.am: $(srcdir)/data.txt $(srcdir)/preproc.sh
	        cd $(srcdir) && $(SHELL) preproc.sh <data.txt >fragment.am

	    include $(srcdir)/fragment.am

	    ...

	If the use forgot to add data.txt and/or preproc.sh in the distribution
	tarball, "make distcheck" would have erroneously succeeded!

	The reason is that, while $(srcdir)/data.txt does not exist, make also
	looks in $(srcdir)/$(srcdir)/data.txt, and in the distcheck-issued
	VPATH build where $(srcdir) is '..', that file exists, as it is
	part of the original development directory.

	* t/distdir.am (distcheck): Adjust to have the build directory be
	'$(distdir)/_build/sub' rather than just '$(distdir)/_build'.  Thanks
	Nicola Fontana for the suggestion.
	* t/distcheck-pr18286.sh: Enhance and tighten a little.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove 't/distcheck-pr18286.sh',
	as it's now passing.
	* t/subdir-am-cond.sh: Adjust to avoid a fully spurious failure due

	include: fix bug in handling of user-defined makefile fragments generation

	If a user defined one single Makefile fragment to be included (via Automake

	dist: ordering of files in DIST_COMMON is deterministic now

	It had likely stopped being deterministic due to the new perl behavior
	of having non-deterministic order of numerating hash keys:

	<http://onionstand.blogspot.ie/2012/12/are-you-relying-on-hash-keys-being.html>
	See also similar commit v1.14-19-g52e6404, albeit in this case the issue
	is likely coming from autom4te/autoconf, not from automake itself.

	When computing lispdir, don't load emacs site wide init file.

	When computing the lispdir emacs was previously invoked with the '-q'
	option to avoid loading the users initialisation files, however, the
	site wide initialisation file was still loaded, in some cases this can
	cause emacs to hang, with the result that a configure can also hang.

	The lisp code that aclocal causes to be executed reduces the load-path
	list (in emacs) to empty.  The load-path is used by emacs to find
	packages which it wants to load.  Currently, if emacs tries to auto
	load a package during shut down, and the package is not found, then
	emacs will hang.  This does seem like an emacs bug, but protecting
	against this in aclocal is simply a case of not loading the site wide
	initialisation file.

	In this patch then the '-q' option to emacs is replaced with '-Q',
	this has the same, the '-Q' option is similar to '-q --no-site-file
	--no-splash'.

	Improve detection of GNU make, avoiding "Arg list too long" errors.

	Such errors could take place when the main makefile included too many
	sub-makefiles, making $(MAKEFILE_LIST) too long and causing the
	recipes $(am__is_gnu_make) to exceed the shell's command-line length
	limits.  This is not a theoretical issue: it could happen for projects
	having lots of C/C++ sources and using automatic dependency tracking,
	which created an included .Po sub-makefile for each of such sources.

2014-04-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	init: ensure $ac_aux_dir is defined before being used

	Since we use '$ac_aux_dir' to define '$am_aux_dir', we need
	to ensure the former has been initialized before we try to
	define the latter, otherwise the definition:

	   am_aux_dir=`cd $ac_aux_dir && pwd`

	will set '$am_aux_dir' to '$HOME', likely causing weird and
	unexpected behaviours.

	This change fixes automake bug#15981.

	  - if there are two or more SOURCEFILE arguments, the

	TAP driver: remove perl implementation (move it into contrib/)

	That implementation was only meant as a standard against which the
	portable awk+shell implementation was to be measured.  Now, since
	Automake 1.12, the latter implementation is fully functional and
	already used in the wild, and in fact feature-par with the perl
	implementation.  So the perl implementation is now just slowing
	down and complicating our testsuite.  Let's move it to 'contrib/'
	(we don't want to remove it, in case someone is actually using it
	in the wild).

	* lib/tap-driver.pl: Move it ...

	distcheck: don't allow overriding of --prefix and --srcdir by the user

	Not through AM_DISTCHECK_FLAGS, nor through DISTCHECK_FLAGS.  Apparently,
	some packages got in the habit of relaying all the options passed to the

	in "make distcheck".  This was causing problems, because it also passed

	tests: fix spurious failure when zip is present but unzip is not

	Fixes automake bug#15181.

	* t/dist-formats.tap (have_compressor): When checking that zip(1), also
	check for unzip(1), otherwise "make distcheck" will be unable to extract
	the zip tarball it creates, which will cause spurious failures.  While
	at it, reorganize the existing code a bit.
	* THANKS, NEWS: Update.

	test: avoid false positives in 'cc-no-c-o' script

	Fixes automake bug#14911.

	* t/ax/cc-no-c-o.in: Be more careful in determining whether both the
	'-c' and '-o' options have been passed on the command line to the
	compiler.  In particular, do not spuriously complain in the face of
	options like '-compatibility_version' or '-current_version' (seen on

	forgotten to specify one of the mandatory options (--test-name,
	--log-file, --trs-file) or has not passed any non-option argument.
	Also, be sure to work correctly even when no '--' special argument
	is passed to separate option from non-options arguments.
	* THANKS: Update.

	NEWS: post-release tweaks (for 1.14.x series)

2013-06-27  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: avoid a spurious failure on MacOS X 10.6.8

	Fixes automake bug#14706.

	* t/depcomp2.sh: Strip, from the redirected ./configure stderr, the
	possible error message "rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory", generated
	by cleanup code that doesn't cater to the existence of *.dSYM
	directories sometimes created by the compiler on MacOS X.  This
	"massaging" of ./configure stderr is legitimate, since the spurious
	error message is due not to automake-related code, but to a know
	buglet/limitation of either Autoconf or Mac OS X bundles gcc:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2007-11/msg00017.html>
	Actually, from that link it appears that the original Autoconf issue
	had been fixed, but it must have been re-introduced in the meantime :-(

2013-06-27  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: don't risk hanging on the 'cl' requirement

	On the GNU/Linux boxes of some users that run our testsuite there
	is a '/usr/local/bin/cl' executable, from the IRAF package:

	    <http://iraf.noao.edu/>

	The test 'compile4.sh' (and other tests) try to invoke the 'cl'
	command to check whether it's a Microsoft compiler; the IRAF cl
	is an interactive program, so it hangs on such invocation.  In
	conclusion, the testsuite hangs for those users which have the
	IRAF cl early in PATH.

	Fix the issue by redirecting the input of cl from /dev/null when
	invoking it, which is enough to prevent the cl program from IRAF
	from hanging, and should have no effect on the behaviour of the
	Microsoft compiler.

	This change fixes automake bug#14707.

	* t/ax/am-test-lib.sh (require_tool): Adjust the handling of
	the 'cl' requirement.

	tests: simplify checks for some expected variables values in Makefiles

	Do so by using our custom 'is' auxiliary script rather than grepping
	the output from make.  This is more natural, more robust, and often
	shorter to write.

	Unfortunately, we can't do that in all cases: sometimes we really need
	to match the content of a variable against a regular expressions, and
	we can't know nor are interested in its exact value.

	This is basically a follow-up on commit v1.11-1830-g96401cb of
	2012-02-08 (tests: better way to compare lists in Makefile rules).

	This change fixes automake bug#14560: when two or more user-defined suffix
	rules were present in a single Makefile.am, automake would needlessly
	include definition of some make variables related to C compilation in the
	generated Makefile.in.

	* automake.in (handle_languages): Fix logic to decide whether or not to
	include definitions of C compilation related variables in the generated
	Makefile.in: instead of doing so when two or more user-defined suffix
	rules are seen (which is a completely bogus criterion), do so when two
	or more compiled languages are used.
	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (suffix_rules_count): Remove as no longer used.
	(@EXPORT): Adjust.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (XFAIL_TESTS): No longer list the test script
	'suffix-extra-c-stuff-pr14560.sh', which now passes.
	* NEWS: Update.

	tests: expose automake bug#14560

	Automake needlessly generates definition of make variables related
	to C compilation when two or more user-defined suffix rules are
	present in a single Makefile.am.

	* t/suffix-extra-c-stuff-pr14560.sh: New test, exposing the bug.
	This test is still xfailing.
	* t/no-extra-c-stuff.sh: New test, check for a potential related
	regression.  This regression is not actually present here (so this
	test passes), but it still took place in our first attempt at
	fixing bug#14560 -- so this test has proven to be actually useful.
	* t/no-extra-makefile-code.sh: Improve comments, and tighten the
	grepping checks a little.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (handwritten_TESTS): Add the new tests.
	(XFAIL_TESTS): Add the new xfailing test.

	'--langmap' option, use it.  That is required to avoid spurious
	failures with Exuberant Ctags (at least version 5.8), which by

	recognize.

	tests: fix spurious failure due to missing sleeps

	Fixes automake bug#14528.

	* THANKS: Give credit to that bug's original reporter.

	* t/remake-configure-dependencies.sh: Add few missing '$sleep'
	invocations.  I thought that the sleeps implicit in the configure
	invocation were enough, but they were not, actually.  Here is what
	can happen:

	  1. The config.status script is generated by a configure run.
	  2. ./config.status and make are run.
	  3. The 'print-version' script is modified.
	  4. Since that script is listed in $(CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES),
	     autoconf is re-run.
	  5. On a fast-enough machine, the three steps 2-4 above, even
	     combined, might have taken less than a second to run;
	  6. If the filesystem doesn't have a sub-second timestamp
	     resolution, that means the newly-generated configure has
	     the same timestamp of the old config.status;
	  7. So, config.status is not re-run, and the Makefiles are
	     not updated.
	  8. Spurious failure!

	So we really need more explicit sleeps.

	automake: assume we can always pass '-o' to the C compiler

	It is assumed that we can pass -c -o to the C compiler, so remove
	some special casing and always do that.

	This change is similar in spirit to v1.13.1d-217-g7299c4d "depend: assume
	we can always pass '-o' to the C compiler"

	This change also happen to fix a testsuite failure
	(t/silent-many-languages.sh) when mixing MSVC and GNU fortran, which
	have different default object file extensions (.obj vs. .o). This
	difference in object file extension is not handled well and caused
	Automake to look for MSVC objects with .o extension. Always using -o
	makes MSVC create .o object files and linking succeeds. Not that
	anybody recommends mixing toolchains or anything.

	* bin/automake.in (handle_languages): Remove conditional modification
	of 'output_flag' entry for 'c'.
	(register_language ('name' => 'c')): Add 'output_flag' entry set to '-o'.

	depcomp: avoid trailing backslash in depfile for depmode=msvc7

	When compiling a file without any dependencies (no #includes), the
	msvc7 depmode (and consequently msvc7msys) generates a depfile
	Makefile fragment with the last line ending with a backslash. This
	is less robust than needed.

	Fixes automake bug#14501.

	* lib/depcomp (msvc7): Finish off the depfile Makefile fragment with

	AM_PROG_CC_C_O: don't rely on AC_PROG_CC_C_O, re-implement similar logic

	** Theoretical problems of AC_PROG_CC_C_O:

	  Both cc and $CC are checked to see if they support the '-c' and '-o'
	  options together.
	  This behaviour is highly inconsistent with that of the other macros
	  related to C compiler checks -- which test only $CC.
	  It can also cause unwarranted uses of the 'compile' script on systems
	  where the default 'cc' is inferior, but the user is compiling with a
	  proper, different compiler (e.g., gcc).

	** Practical problems with our previous implementation of C support m4
	   macros in Automake:

	  - AM_PROG_AR must now be called *before* AC_PROG_CC; this wasn't the
	    case before, and it turns out there are packages in the wild that
	    relied on the old behaviour.

	  - The cross-referenced requirements and macro rewrites juggled among
	    AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CC_C_O and AM_PROG_CC_C_O caused warnings in
	    autoconf; for example, in our test 't/libobj3.sh', we could see
	    warnings like these (here slightly tweaked for legibility):

	        configure.ac:5: AC_REQUIRE: `AC_PROG_CC' expanded before required
	        autoconf/c.m4:567: AC_PROG_CC_C_O is expanded from...
	        autoconf/c.m4:429: AC_LANG_COMPILER(C) is expanded from...
	        autoconf/lang.m4:329: AC_LANG_COMPILER_REQUIRE is expanded from...
	        autoconf/general.m4:2606: AC_COMPILE_IFELSE is expanded from...
	        m4sugar/m4sh.m4:639: AS_IF is expanded from...
	        autoconf/general.m4:2031: AC_CACHE_VAL is expanded from...
	        autoconf/general.m4:2052: AC_CACHE_CHECK is expanded from...
	        aclocal.m4:70: AM_PROG_AR is expanded from...
	        configure.ac:5: the top level

	** Fix all of that:

	We fix all of the described issues with a new internal m4 macro
	_AM_PROG_CC_C_O (inspired to, but not based on, AC_PROG_CC_C_O) that
	gets tacked on to AC_PROG_CC automatically (this is done in the
	Automake-generated aclocal.m4) and that takes care of checking and
	adjusting '$CC' for "-c -o" support.

	The macro AM_PROG_CC_C_O is still present, but is now just a thin
	wrapper around such Automake-enhanced AC_PROG_CC.

	It is worth noting that the present patch causes three slight
	*backward-incompatibilities*:

	  1. The name cache variable used by AM_PROG_CC_C_O is no longer
	     computed (at configure runtime!) from the content of '$CC',
	     but is statically defined as 'am_cv_prog_cc_c_o'.

	  2. 'cc' is no longer checked by AM_PROG_CC_C_O, only '$CC' is.

	  3. AM_PROG_CC_C_O no longer AC_DEFINE the C preprocessor symbol
	     'NO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O'.

	Given however that the third change can easily be worked around, that
	the first two changes can be legitimately seen as bug fixes, and that
	the new semantics introduced by such changes will simplify the transition
	to Automake 2.0 (when the 'subdir-objects' will always be enabled
	unconditionally), we believe they are acceptable to be shipped with
	Automake 1.14.

	With this patch, we also revert some of the testsuite adjustments done
	in previous commit v1.13.2-178-g9877109 of 2013-05-24 (compile: rewrite
	AC_PROG_CC with AM_PROG_CC_C_O contents).  Such adjustments are no longer
	needed.

	* m4/minuso.m4 (_AM_PROG_CC_C_O): New internal macro, basically and
	adjusted version of a merge between Autoconf-provided AC_PROG_CC_C_O
	and our old implementation of AM_PROG_CC_C_O.
	(AM_PROG_CC_C_O): Redefine as a simple wrapper around AC_PROG_CC.
	* m4/init.m4 (AC_PROG_CC): Append _AM_PROG_CC_C_O, not AM_PROG_CC_C_O,
	to the pre-existing expansion of this macro.
	* m4/ar-lib.m4 (AM_PROG_AR): No longer require it to be expanded after
	AC_PROG_CC.
	* t/aclocal-deps.sh: Move AC_PROG_CC invocation after AC_PROG_RANLIB
	and AM_PROG_AR invocations.  Things should work this way too (as they
	used to).
	* t/subobj-clean-lt-pr10697.sh: Likewise.
	* t/alloca.sh: Move AC_PROG_CC invocation after AM_PROG_AR invocation.
	* t/condlib.sh: Likewise.

	and reduce code duplication.
	* t/ccnoco.sh: Make autoconf warnings fatal.
	* t/subpkg.sh: Likewise.
	* t/ccnoco-lib.sh: Likewise, and fix a comment.
	* t/link_cond.sh: Enhance a couple of error messages.
	* configure.ac: Drop "nullification" of AM_PROG_CC_C_O.
	* NEWS: Adjust.

2013-05-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	compile: rewrite AC_PROG_CC with AM_PROG_CC_C_O contents

	This is a much simpler rewrite than the one we attempted in the past,
	and that was later removed by commit 'v1.13.1d-137-g32eb770' of
	2013-05-11 (compile: avoid AC_PROG_CC messy rewrite).

	Not only this change simplifies the code a little, but has the welcome
	collateral effect of making automatic dependency tracking work better
	with compilers that doesn't grasp the '-c' and '-o' options together.
	Issues in that setup have been caught by several failures in the target
	'check-no-cc-c-o'.

	Unfortunately, this change has less welcome collateral effects:

	  1. AM_PROG_AR must now be called *after* AC_PROG_CC;

	  2. Autoconf emits extra warnings when used with Automake-generated
	     aclocal.m4.

	These are unacceptable regressions for a release, but since we are
	going to fix them soon enough in a follow-up patch (surely to be
	applied before Automake 1.14 is released) we don't worry too much.

	* m4/init.m4: Redefine AC_PROG_CC early, to automatically invoke
	AM_PROG_CC_C_O as well.  Accordingly, drop now-unneeded "automagical"
	AM_PROG_CC_C_O expansion at later time (which took place thanks to
	a AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_PRE call).
	* m4/minuso.m4 (AM_PROG_CC_C_O): Ensure the expansion of the body
	of this macro takes place with C as "current Autoconf language" (use
	AC_LANG_PUSH/AC_LANG_POP).
	* m4/ar-lib.m4 (AM_PROG_AR): Likewise.  Also, require this macro to
	be expanded *after* AC_PROG_CC (so that any rewrite of $CC, if required,
	has already taken place).
	* t/add-missing.tap: Adjust to avoid spurious failures.
	* t/aclocal-deps.sh: Likewise, by having AM_PROG_AR called *after*
	AC_PROG_CC.
	* t/subobj-clean-lt-pr10697.sh: Likewise.

2013-05-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: use append mode to capture parallel make output

	This will allow us to run the Automake testsuite forcing all the make
	invocations in the test cases to run in parallel mode [1], but without
	hitting the spurious failure reported in automake bug#11413.

	See also:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-make/2013-05/msg00135.html>

	The make invocations in the test cases can be forced to run in parallel
	mode by, e.g., invoking "make check" like this:

	      make check AM_TESTSUITE_MAKE="make -j16"

	The possible spurious failures hinted above are due to the fact that
	the redirected output of parallel make can racily lose lines.  For
	example, if GNU make (3.82) is run with -j10 on a Makefile like this:

	    all = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
	    default: $(all)
	    $(all):
	            @sleep 0.$$(($RANDOM % 10)); echo $@

	and has its standard output redirected in overwrite-mode to a regular
	file, it looses a line of that output every 15 runs or so on a Fedora
	17 system with 64 ppc64 cores.  Redirection in append mode does not
	suffer of this problem, as explained here:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2009-03/msg00073.html>

	See also previous commits v1.12-63-g45c1fcd of 2012-05-05 (tests: use
	append mode to capture parallel make output) and Release-1-10-280-g6426999

	Instead, properly use the -E, -O, or -M options of run_make.
	The occurrences of the 'run_make' invocations using output
	redirection has been found by the recently-introduced maintainer
	check 'sc_tests_no_run_make_redirect'.

	lint: warn against redirected 'run_make' invocations

	The testsuite shell function 'run_make()' has the three options
	-E, -O and -M to perform the various kind of output redirections,
	so the test scripts should use them instead of redirecting the
	output "by hand":

	    run_make ARGS >stdout           =>  run_make -O ARGS
	    run_make ARGS >stderr           =>  run_make -E ARGS
	    run_make ARGS >stdout 2>stderr  =>  run_make -O -E ARGS
	    run_make ARGS >output 2>&1      =>  run_make -M ARGS

	See the commit message of v1.13.2-13-gc7cfa09, 2013-05-22
	(tests: run_make: options to do command redirection) for an
	explanation of why this is a good idea.

	It's worth noting that the present patch only introduced a new
	static maintainer check looking against the undesired idioms,
	but doesn't yet remove usages of such idioms from the testsuite.
	That will be done by follow-up patch(es).

	tests: run_make: options to do command redirection

	Let's improve the API of the 'run_make()' helper shell function by
	adding three new options:

	  -O   Save the standard output from make on disk, in a regular file
	       named 'stdout'.

	  -E   Save the standard error from make on disk, in a regular file
	       named 'stderr'.

	  -M   Save both the standard output and standard error from make on
	       disk, in a regular file named 'output'. This option supersedes
	       both the '-O' and '-E' options.

	This new API has two main advantages.

	  1. Its use will allow us to get rid of more cumbersome idioms
	     like, e.g.,

	       $MAKE check >stdout && { cat stdout; exit 1; }
	       cat stdout

	     That can now be substituted with a simpler one:

	       run_make -e FAIL -O check

	  2. More importantly, using the new API we will prevent any extra output
	     from the shell traces of the code in run_make to be redirected along
	     with the make stderr (where that was redirected).  This problem was
	     present in usages like, e.g.,

	       run_make TESTS=foo.test check 2>stderr && exit 1
	       grep 'expected error message' stderr

	     Such usages are now to be rewritten as follows:

	       run_make -e FAIL -E TESTS=foo.test check
	       grep 'expected error message' stderr

	     ensuring that 'stderr' won't end up containing unrelated stuff.

	Note that we do not convert in bulk the old idioms and the use of
	redirected 'run_make' invocations with this patch.  We only convert
	some occurrences, to ensure that the new implementation of 'run_make'
	is sound enough.  More sweeping conversions will likely be done in
	follow-up patches.

	* t/tap-xfail-tests.sh: Use the new 'run_make' API.
	* t/test-driver-cond.sh: Likewise.

2013-05-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: only activate 'unset' alias if required

	This makes the test logs easier to read for most shells (which do not
	actually require that alias).  This is especially important now that
	'unset' is used in the new 'run_make()' function, and that function is
	likely going to be used more and more in the future.

	* t/ax/test-lib.sh (_am_unset, unset): Only define this function and
	alias if "unset VAR" returns a non-zero exit status when VAR is already
	unset.

2013-05-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: better idiom to override make macro defs on the cmdline

	We now do so with a new wrapper shell function 'run_make()', which
	relies on the use of AM_MAKEFLAGS, avoiding the use of the '-e' make
	option.  The use of that option (that causes the environment variables
	to take precedence over the macro definitions in the Makefile) has
	proved to be quite brittle in the past, causing annoying and sometimes
	problematic spurious failures.  This has worsened in some still
	unpublished work going on in development branches.  It's time to solve
	the issue once and for all.

	Note that we do not convert all uses of $MAKE in the testsuite right
	away; we might do so in follow-up changes, with leisure, to avoid a
	"patch bomb" effect (this commit is already too much of a bomb itself).
	What we do in this commit is to get rid of all "$MAKE -e" invocations.

	We admit that the implementation and feature-set of 'run_make()' are
	far from perfect, but good enough for our current purposes.  We'll
	improve 'run_make()' if and when the need arises.

	* t/ax/am-test-lib.sh (run_make): New function.  Run $MAKE with the
	given command-line arguments, handling command-line override of variable
	definitions in a smart way (using AM_MAKEFLAGS if a non-GNU make
	implementation is detected to be in use).
	(useless_vpath_rebuild): Adjust to use 'run_make', to avoid a spurious
	maintainer check failure.
	(yl_distcheck): Use 'run_make' rather than bare '$MAKE'.
	(single_quote, append_single_quoted, is_valid_varname): New auxiliary
	function, used, directly or indirectly, by it.
	* Many tests: Adjust to avoid the use of "$MAKE -e", and prefer the
	use of 'run_make' in few other contexts as well, where it makes sense.
	Other minor fixlets while at it.

	Do so even when the 'info-in-builddir' option is present, or when

	This fixes failures in the following tests, when they are run with

	    - txinfo-nodist-info.sh
	    - txinfo23.sh
	    - txinfo24.sh
	    - txinfo28.sh
	    - txinfo25.sh

	BTW, notice that the test 'txinfo-builddir.sh' fails with FreeBSD make
	as well, but that is due to a known FreeBSD make VPATH issue (the same
	described in automake bug#7884).  But that is not a regression, since
	the 'info-in-builddir' option will be new in Automake 1.14.  Moreover,
	we already warn in the manual that the use of that option can indeed
	cause problems with VPATH builds done by non-GNU make.

	* lib/am/lisp.am (.el.elc): By initializing the 'am__dir' properly
	here.  For most shells, the lacking initialization, while technically
	incorrect, didn't cause any issue in practice, because in those shells
	"test -d" returns an exit status of 0. But with /usr/xpg4/bin/sh, the
	shell complains like this: "test: argument expected", and returns a
	non-zero exit status.  This caused testsuite failures in several lisp
	tests.
	Also, while we are at it, use more proper quoting in the recipe, to
	ensure a missing initialization to now be caught by more forgiving
	shells as well.
	* NEWS: Update.

2013-05-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: sanitize 'unset' usages

	In some shells (e.g., Solaris 10 /bin/ksh, or NetBSD 5.1 /bin/sh),
	"unset VAR" returns a non-zero exit status in case the VAR variable
	is already unset.  This doesn't interact well with our usage of
	"set -e" in the testsuite.  So far, we've avoided spurious failures
	by either explicitly ignoring the exit status from unset:

	    unset VAR || :

	or explicitly ensuring that a variable is set, before trying to
	unset it:

	    VAR=; unset VAR

	But we can do better, by aliasing the 'unset' command to a custom
	function that will take care of these details for us.  This will
	avoid us annoying spurious failures in the future, failures that
	have already bitten us too much times.  For an example, refer to
	commit 'v1.12.2-88-g5b1dae5' of 2012-08-05 (tests: avoid tons of

	subroutines to return a 'LANG_*' constant, but only a transformed
	extension, if required.  To decide whether further processing of the
	source file should be stopped, rely on a new set of 'lang_*_ignore'
	subroutines, defaulting to a subroutine that returns false.
	Accordingly, don't special case the handling of '.vapi' files anymore,
	instead rely on ...
	(lang_vala_ignore, lang_header_ignore): ... these new subroutines to

	subdir-objects: enable unconditionally

	See automake bug#13378.

	The fact that Automake-generated Makefiles places compiled object files
	in the current directory by default, also when the corresponding source
	file is in a subdirectory, is basically an historical accident, due to
	the fact that the 'subdir-objects' option had only been introduced in
	April 1999, starting with commit 'user-dep-gen-branchpoint-56-g88b5959',
	and never made the default, likely to avoid backwards-compatibility
	issues.

	Since we believe the behaviour enabled by the 'subdir-objects' is the
	only natural and most useful one, we make it the only only one available,
	simplifying the Automake implementation and APIs a little in the process.

	This change is basically an adjusted backport of Automake-NG commit
	'v1.12.1-313-g14fe163' of 2012-06-07, "[ng] subdir-objects: enable
	unconditionally".

	* NEWS: Update.

	object files are no longer placed in the current directory by
	default, but rather in the same directory of the source file.
	(LIBOBJS): Now the $(LIBOBJS) and $(ALLOCA) variables can also
	be used outside of the directory where their sources lie.
	(List of Automake options): Report the 'subdir-objects' option
	as a no-op, existing only for compatibility with older versions
	of Automake.
	Other related minor adjustments.
	* bin/automake.in (LANG_PROCESS): Remove, it's no longer needed.
	(handle_languages): Don't test whether option 'subdir-objects'
	is set (just assume it is), and do not use the '%SUBDIROBJ%'
	transform when processing '.am' fragments.
	(lang_sub_obj): Delete, it would just return 'LANG_SUBDIR'
	unconditionally now.
	(lang_lex_rewrite): Adjust.  Don't test whether the option
	'subdir-objects' is set (just assume it is).
	(lang_yacc_rewrite): Likewise.
	(handle_single_transform): Likewise.  Remove an obsolete
	comment.  Add a proper "FIXME" comments about a fragment
	of code that might have become dead code now.
	(handle_LIBOBJS_or_ALLOCA): Simplify assuming that the option
	'subdir-objects' is always set.  Accordingly, there's no need
	to warn anymore if '$(LIBOBJS)' or '$(ALLOCA)' are used outside
	the '$config_libobj_dir' directory (as specified by autoconf
	macro 'AC_CONFIG_LIBOBJ_DIR').

	  Use AC_DEFUN_ONCE to define AM_PROG_CC_C_O
	  compile: avoid AC_PROG_CC messy rewrite
	  options: tiny simplification in dealing with incompatible versions

2013-05-11  Nick Bowler  <nbowler@elliptictech.com>  (tiny change)

	Use AC_DEFUN_ONCE to define AM_PROG_CC_C_O

	If AM_PROG_CC_C_O is expanded multiple times, and the compiler does not
	support -c and -o together, each expansion of the macro will prepend
	the compile script to CC.  This can result in the compile script
	invoking the compile script, which at best pointless and silly.
	Fortunately, there does not appear to be any serious problems as the
	first compile invocation strips out -o options, causing subsequent
	invocations of the script to merely exec their arguments.

	Other than fixing the above, this should not normally cause any changes
	to the resulting configure script, except in the (hopefully rare) case
	where AM_PROG_CC_C_O is directly expanded (i.e., *not* using AC_REQUIRE)
	in the body of a macro defined with AC_DEFUN.  In that case, the use of
	AC_DEFUN_ONCE may cause the expansion of AM_PROG_CC_C_O to appear
	earlier in the configure script.

	* m4/minuso.m4: Change the definition of AM_PROG_CC_C_O to use
	AC_DEFUN_ONCE, avoiding problems caused by multiple expansions.

2013-05-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	compile: avoid AC_PROG_CC messy rewrite

	Instead, add an hook to AC_OUTPUT to have AM_PROG_CC_C_O invoked

	* lib/Automake/Options.pm (_process_option_list): Here, when an

	In fact, if the same incompatible version number is specified in

	make flags analysis: be more robust

	In particular, catering to option-with-argument bundled together
	with options-without-arguments, as in:

	   # With GNU make 3.82:
	   $ make -f- <<<'all:; echo "$$MFLAGS"' -s -k -I none
	   -skiI none

	   # With development version of GNU make (Git commit b5ea49b):
	   $ make -f- <<<'all:; @echo "$$MFLAGS"' -I none
	   -skiI none

	This fixes some lingering failures in the testsuite; precisely, in
	tests 'make-dryrun.tap' and 'make-keepgoing.tap'.

	* t/header-vars.am (am__make_running_with_option): Enhance.

2013-05-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	make flags analysis: cater to GNU make 3.83 (still unreleased as of now)

	The current development version of GNU make (that is planned to become
	GNU make 3.83, sooner or later) has changed the format its $(MFLAGS)
	variable slightly, removing the space between an option and its argument:

	   # With GNU make 3.82, compiled from official tarball:
	   $ make -f- <<<'all:; @echo "$$MFLAGS"' -I none
	   -I none

	   # With development version of GNU make (Git commit b5ea49b):
	   $ make -f- <<<'all:; @echo "$$MFLAGS"' -I none
	   -Inone

	This was done on purpose, in order to support more easily the new
	option '-O', which takes an optional argument; see:

	  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-make/2013-05/msg00001.html>

	So Just adapt to the new format as well.

	* t/header-vars.am (am__make_running_with_option): Adjust to cater
	to the new GNU make behaviour.

	compat: substitute '@mkdir_p@' as '$(MKDIR_P)' unconditionally

	We had started to do so only when the obsolete AM_PROG_MKDIR_P variable
	was used, but that has recently turned out not to be not good enough,
	because Gettext 0.18.2 (the latest one at the moment of writing) is using
	the modern macro AC_PROG_MKDIR_P in its '*.m4' files, but at the same time
	is still using the obsolete make variable '$(mkdir_p)' in its Makefile
	fragments.  This has been causing failures in real-world packages
	bootstrapped with latest Gettext (0.18.2) and with bleeding-edge automake.

	See for example:

	  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2013-04/msg00009.html>

	And the worst things is that those failures have been basically silent
	and unnoticeable up until the final "make install" --- that is, after
	the affected package had been bootstrapped, configured and built.  Yikes!

	This issue has been reported to the Gettext developers:

	  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/2013-04/msg00044.html>

	But even if they will quickly fix it, Gettext 0.18.2 will remain
	affected.

	The fix we can implement in Automake is small and unobtrusive enough,
	definitely worth having in order to save the users and developers from
	having to deal with this hard-to-spot issue.

	subdirs: don't return false positives for the '-k' option's presence

	This change fixes automake bug#12554.

	The old implementation of the code descending into $(SUBDIRS)
	entries used the following snippet to decide whether make is running
	with the '-k' a.k.a. '--keep-going' option, and thus whether a failure
	in a subdirectory should prevent the descent in the following ones:

	    fail= failcom='exit 1'; \
	    for f in x $$MAKEFLAGS; do \
	      case $$f in \
	        *=* | --[!k]*);; \
	        *k*) failcom='fail=yes';; \
	      esac; \
	    done

	It's clear that the second pattern in the 'case' construct could possibly
	match false positives, for examples in these two cases:

	    make check TESTS="x.test k.test"
	    make -I /usr/local/kool-fragments

	which are somewhat unusual, but not invalid.  So we need a more resilient
	implementation, as we did for the detection of the '-n' flag.

	This implementation is now provided by the new private macro
	'$(am__make_keepgoing)' (introduced in recent commits); so we can
	just us that to fix the bug.

	* lib/am/subdirs.am ($(am__recursive_targets)): Use '$(am__make_keepgoing)'
	instead of ad-hoc and more brittle checks.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove the now-passing test case
	't/subdir-keep-going-pr12554.sh'.

	shell code that determines whether the current make instance is
	running with a given one-letter option (e.g., -k, -n) that takes

	is '-n' (support for '-k' will be added soon).

	tar: format 'ustar' cannot support UID/GID longer than 21 bits

	See automake bug#8343 and bug#13588.

	POSIX 1988 'ustar' format is defined with *fixed-size* fields. There
	is notably a 21 bits limit (2097151) for the UID and the GID.

	Tom Rini tom_rini@mentor.com says (in bug#8343):

	    When the user has a UID or GID that is larger than the ustar format
	    supports, pax does not error out gracefully in some cases (FC13).

	Marc Herbert <marc.herbert@intel.com> adds (in bug#8343):

	    When "configure" is run by a user with an UID bigger than 21 bits,
	    BSD pax 3.4 aborts when trying to create the 'conftest.tar' test
	    archive and leaves an empty or corrupted conftest.tar file behind.
	    In the next step, pax tries to extract this incomplete or corrupted
	    archive and this *** hangs the whole ./configure script ***.

	    Note: GNU cpio 2.9 pretends to pass the test but it is a LIE: it
	    silently truncates any big UID to its lower 21 bits. I don't know
	    what can be the consequences of this lie.

	    I think there is currently a design issue in automake/m4/tar.m4
	    considering that a ustar archive should should *never* succeed when
	    ./configure is run from a big user ID.

	Months later, Petr Hracek <phracek@redhat.com> reports a similar issue
	(in bug#13588) for Fedora 17:

	    I am trying to solve problem in case a user is created with big
	    UID and during configuration pax hangs with message

	        ATTENTION! pax archive volume change required.
	        Ready for archive volume: 1
	        Input archive name or "." to quit pax.
	        Archive name >

	    and needs user interaction.

	    Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=843376>

	Time to fix this issue, on the line of a preliminary patch provided by
	Petr Hracek in bug#13588.  The final patch ended up being remarkably
	different from that original proposition, though.

	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR): If the UID or GID of the current user is
	too high (> 2097151), the 'ustar' format cannot work.  Adjust checks
	accordingly.  Some related code reordering and clean-up.

	compat: reinstate support for obsolete $(INCLUDES) variable

	Since INCLUDES and AM_CPPFLAGS can be both used at the same time in a
	single project, and interact in a non-obvious way, switching away from
	INCLUDES is, unfortunately, not simply a matter of doing a mindless
	INCLUDES -> AM_CPPFLAGS substitution.  In fact, the transition from a
	"INCLUDES + CPPFLAGS" setup to a "AM_CPPFLAGS only" setup could cause
	subtle bugs to sneak into the build systems of the client packages
	doing the transition.  Forcing this risk upon our users is definitely
	not worth the small enhancement in consistency and cleanliness that
	the removal of INCLUDES would give us.

	For a more extended rationale and related discussions, see:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2013-02/msg00001.html>

	This change basically reverts commit v1.13-8-g880595d.

2013-04-19  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	perl: perl subroutine prototypes are problematic, don't use them

	Basically, in perl, "subroutine prototypes" are not prototypes at all;
	rather, they are a trick to allow user-defined subroutines that behave
	like perl built-in functions.  For example, prototyped subroutines can
	be called without parentheses, and can impose context on their arguments.

	Such semantics can be useful in some selected situations, but might also
	easily cause unexpected and harmful behaviours and side effects if we
	try to use perl prototypes as we would use C prototypes.

	See the excellent article "Far More than Everything You've Ever Wanted
	to Know about Prototypes in Perl" by Tom Christiansen for more detailed
	information:

	    <http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=861966>
	    <http://web.archive.org/web/20080421062920/\
	     library.n0i.net/programming/perl/articles/fm_prototypes>

	It is important to note that modern perl allows a non-predeclared
	subroutine to be called without the '&' character, as long as its
	call uses proper parentheses:

	    foo 'str', 2;   # will trigger errors if foo is not predeclared
	    foo('str', 2);  # ok even if foo is not predeclared
	    &foo('str', 2); # ditto; but the '&' is old-style and redundant

	Note also that the prototype indicating "no argument":

	    sub func() { ... }

	can actually be useful, and has no discernible downsides, so we'll
	keep using it where it makes sense.

	Also, in few, selected cases, we *want* to have subroutines behave like
	perl builtins (e.g., we want the 'append_exeext' function to be able
	to take a code block as first argument).  In such cases, we will of
	course continue to make use of perl subroutine prototypes.

	Let's finally see an example that might clarify the kind of problems the
	use of subroutine prototypes in perl can cause.  This is just scratching
	the surface; there are several other aspects, typically subtler and more
	dangerous, that are not touched here.

	If you have the prototyped subroutine definition:

	    sub foo ($@)
	    {
	        my $s = shift;
	        print "SCALAR: $s\n";
	        print "ARRAY: @_\n";
	    }

	and call 'foo' in code like:

	    @list = (-1, 0, 1);
	    foo(@list);

	you won't get a compile-time nor a runtime error (as a naive interpretation
	of the "prototype" characterization would let you think).  Rather, the
	prototype will cause the array '@list' will be coerced into scalar context
	before being passed too 'foo', which means that its *length* (3) will be
	passed to 'foo' as first argument; and since no further arguments are
	present after '@list', that *void* will be coerced to an empty list before
	being passed to 'foo'.

	So code above will have the result of printing:

	  SCALAR: 3
	  ARRAY:

	Quite tricky, and definitely a behaviour we don't want to rely on.

	* automake.in: Delete most subroutine prototypes.  Fix few of the

	aclocal: just warn if the primary local m4 dir doesn't exist (don't error)

	Related to automake bug#13514.

	Every package which does not need to have the local m4 macro
	directory pre-existing in the version control system (because
	e.g., it does not have nor need any private m4 macros) would
	fail during the "autoreconf -vfi" phase if AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([m4])
	is specified in configure.ac (it could be to instruct tools like
	'autopoint' and 'libtoolize' to use 'm4' as the local directory
	where to install definitions of their m4 macros, and to instruct
	aclocal to look into it).  The failure would go like this:

	  autoreconf: Entering directory `.'
	  autoreconf: running: aclocal --force
	  aclocal: error: couldn't open directory 'm4': No such file or directory
	  autoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 1

	The problem is that when 'aclocal' is run for the first time during
	'autoreconf', the directory 'm4' does not exist yet.  It will be
	created by e.g., 'libtoolize' or 'autopoint' later on.  During the
	second 'aclocal' run, the 'm4' directory exists and aclocal does not
	complain.

	To work around this issue, we degrade the error to a simple warning.
	The warning is still quite useful when aclocal is run by hand - so
	we are not removing completely.

	maint: describe new versioning and branching scheme, and adjust to it

	See discussion about automake bug#13578 for more details and background.

	Basically, for the versioning scheme:

	  - micro versions only for bug and regression fixing;
	  - minor versions for new backward-compatible features, and new
	    non-fatal deprecations;
	  - major versions for backward-incompatibilities, complex new
	    features, and major refactoring.

	And for the git branching scheme:

	  + branch 'next' is for the upcoming major version;
	  + branch 'master' is now for the upcoming minor version;
	  + branch 'maint' is for the upcoming micro (bug-fixing) version;
	  + the merging hierarchy is: 'maint' -> 'master' -> 'next'.

	preproc: add support for relative names in included fragments

	The rationale for this change is that it is annoying to have
	to repeat the directory name when including a Makefile fragment.
	For deep directory structures these repeats can generate a lot
	of bloat.  It also hinders reuse and easy directory restructuring
	if all Makefile fragments have to know exactly where they live.

	Suggested by Bob Friesenhahn, and later discussed in bug#13524.

	In the course of discussion, the following notations were rejected:
	&{reldir}& - to hard to type, {reldir} - interferes with ${reldir},
	{am_reldir} - short form {D} interferes with ${D}, @am_reldir@ - short
	form @D@ interferes with AC_SUBST([D]) as well as invading the
	config.status turf. Other notations were also suggested...

	* automake.in (read_am_file): Add third argument specifying the
	relative directory of this Makefile fragment compared to the
	main Makefile.  Replace %reldir% and %canon_reldir% in the
	fragment with this relative directory (with slashes etc, or
	canonicalized).
	(read_main_am_file): Adjust.
	* t/preproc-reldir.sh: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Augment.
	* doc/automake.texi (Include): Document the new feature.

	tests on TAP: don't run the driver with perl unconditionally

	* t/ax/tap-setup.sh: When a 'Makefile.am' was pre-existent in the
	test directory at the moment the client test script sourced this
	file, said 'Makefile.am' was tweaked to provide it with a proper
	definition of TEST_LOG_DRIVER.  However, there was an error in this
	automatic definition, since it caused the TAP test driver to be
	unconditionally invoked with perl.  This wasn't an issue in most
	situations, since perl is smart enough to re-execute a given script
	with the proper interpreter if it sees a she-bang line that doesn't
	seem to point to perl itself.  Still, there is no reason to do
	something blatantly wrong even if our tools correct the dumb mistake
	for us.  So fix the TEST_LOG_DRIVER definition.

	NEWS: IRIX is still supported; only SGI depmode no longer is

	This change is for the master branch (see the similar commit
	'v1.13.1b-3-g97f04a5' on the maint branch).

	The only IRIX-specific support that is actually removed in master (and
	thus in the next major Automake version) is the depcomp support for the
	SGI compiler.  That means that automatic dependency tracking will no
	longer work with that compiler, but "normal" compilation should still
	work, at least until the compiler is supported by Autoconf.

	So there is no point in alarming our users by stating in the NEWS file
	that "support for IRIX and the SGI compilers has been removed"; after
	all, while we don't test on nor particularly care about IRIX anymore,
	that doesn't mean we are deliberately breaking it, and the likelihood
	of an intended breakage there is very low.

	compat: reinstate AM_CONFIG_HEADER and AM_PROG_CC_STDC

	Make them give runtime warnings in the obsolete category, but apart
	from that, make them behave as they did in Automake 1.12.x and earlier.

	While removing those macros seemed quite harmless, because it didn't put
	a real burden on the developers (requiring them just to do a quick edit
	to configure.ac), it turned out to place an unsustainable burden (or at
	least, a burden perceived as such) on distro packagers who use the latest
	Automake to bootstrap existing packages.  Many of those packages, while
	having likely updated to AC_CONFIG_HEADERS in their development version,
	still used AM_CONFIG_HEADER in their existing released versions, and the
	removal of this macro would have thus forced the Fedora packagers to
	patch all of them.  References:

	  <http://www.mail-archive.com/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/msg52840.html>
	  <http://www.spinics.net/lists/fedora-devel/msg175922.html>
	  <http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2013/01/autotools-mythbuster-automake-pains>

	In addition, the Fedora packagers have already decided to patch their
	Automake 1.13.1 to reinstate the AM_CONFIG_HEADER and AM_PROG_CC_STDC
	macros (plus other macros that I don't believe it's worth worrying about):

	  <http://www.spinics.net/lists/fedora-devel/msg176098.html>

	  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/automake.git/commit/?id=ffe6bc39>

	So, rather than having one more incompatibility floating around, we
	better mirror that change (or, actually, its relevant parts) in the
	upstream.

	compat: restore AM_PROG_MKDIR, again

	OK, this is getting ridiculous, but we cannot remove this macro yet
	(and, yes, the fault for this mess lies entirely on me; let's not
	dwell on that, thank you very much).

	Gettext (so far the greatest "offender" in the use of AM_PROG_MKDIR), in
	its latest release 0.18.2, has removed all the uses of that macro still
	present in its code base.  So I thought we could finally and safely
	remove it.  Wrong.  If a package's 'configure.ac' contains a call like:

	   AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION([0.18])

	then the 'autopoint' script will bring the data files from the Gettext
	release *1.18* into the package's tree -- yes, even even if the developer
	has installed *and is using* Gettext 1.18.2!  Now, these data files
	comprise m4 files (that will be seen by subsequent aclocal and autoconf
	calls), and of course, the pre-0.18.2 version of some of these files
	still contains occurrences of AM_PROG_MKDIR_P -- so Automake 1.13 errors
	out, and we lose.  This has already happened in practice:

	  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grep/2013-01/msg00003.html>

	Moreover, while we might see it as not unreasonable to ask a developer
	using Automake 1.14 to also update Gettext to 1.18.2, that would not
	be enough; in order for gettext to use the correct data files, our
	developer would have to update his configure.ac to read:

	   AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION([0.18.2])

	thus requiring *all* of his co-developers to install Gettext 1.18.2,
	even if they are still using, say, Automake 1.13.  Bad.

	So we re-instate this macro as a simple alias for AC_PROG_MKDIR (plus
	a non-fatal runtime warning in the 'obsolete' category), and drop any
	plan to remove it (see how much good those plans have done us so far).

	Note that NEWS is not yet adjusted, since we'll have to adjust it in
	maint before (to minimize spurious merge conflicts).

	init.m4: add probe to check "rm -f" without args work

	See automake bug#10828.

	POSIX will say in a future version that running "rm -f" with no argument
	is OK: <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>).

	We want to be able to make that assumption in our Makefile recipes.

	ithreads: use runtime (not configure time) detection of perl threads

	I can't imagine the runtime checks being a big runtime penalty, so there
	shouldn't be a need to do the checks at configure check and hardcode the
	result in the generated automake.

	With the current system, it means if you change your perl config (build
	perl w/threads, build automake, build perl w/out threads), or deploy a
	compiled automake package on a different system (build had threads, but
	deployed system does not), you get errors when trying to run automake.

	So take the logic from configure.ac and move it to the one place where
	PERL_THREADS is used (lib/Automake/Config.in) and do the version/config
	checking at runtime.

	* bootstrap.sh (PERL_THREADS): Delete assignment and use in sed.

	compile: use 'compile' script when "-c -o" is used with losing compilers

	Do so seen when only source files in the "current" directory are present.

	This commit is part of a series of related changes addressing automake
	bug#13378 (see also the plan 'PLANS/subdir-objects.txt').

	Before this change, Automake-generated C compilation rules mistakenly
	passed the "-c -o" options combination unconditionally (even to losing
	compiler) when the 'subdir-objects' was used but sources were only
	present in the top-level directory.  Issue spotted by Nick Bowler:

	  <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=13378#35>
	  <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=13378#44>

	We fix this by having Automake redefine AC_PROG_CC to take over the role
	of AM_PROG_CC_C_O and to require the 'compile' script unconditionally
	(albeit that will continue to be invoked only when inferior compilers
	are detected).

	Among other things, this means AM_PROG_CC_C_O explicitly is no longer
	required; that macro is still supported for backward-compatibility, but
	calling it is basically a no-op now.

	This change has some pros and some cons (obviously, we believe the former
	outweighs the latter).  Here are the most relevant ones:

	+ Pros 1:
	  Some logic in the Automake script has been simplified.
	+ Pros 2:
	  That simplification has automatically fixed an actual bug (see
	  Nick's mails referenced above; admittedly, that was present only in
	  corner-case situations, but still); the test 't/ccnoco4.sh', which
	  demonstrated the bug and has been failing so far, now passes.
	+ Pros 3:
	  Things works more "automagically" now (no need to manually add the
	  AM_PROG_CC_C_O macro to configure.ac anymore).

	* Cons 1:
	  The 'compile' script will be required in all projects using C
	  compilation; this will only be a problem for packages not using
	  '--add-missing'.  However, such packages are definitely more rare
	  than the ones using '--add-missing', and adjusting them will be
	  trivial -- just copy the compile script over from the new Automake
	  installation.
	* Cons 2:
	  The copy & paste of autoconf internals hack this change has introduced
	  in our "rewrite" of AC_PROG_CC is really an egregious abomination.  It
	  can only be justified with the fact that we expect future versions of
	  autoconf to implement the semantics we need directly in AC_PROG_CC, so
	  that we'll be able to leverage that (since Automake 1.14 will require
	  the latest Autoconf version released).

	Now, the detailed list of file-by-file changes ...

	* automake.in ($seen_cc_c_o): Remove this global variable.
	(scan_autoconf_traces): Don't set it, and do not trace the
	'AM_PROG_CC_C_O' m4 macro.
	(lang_c_rewrite): Remove, no longer needed.
	* doc/automake.texi: Adjust expected "autoreconf --install" output
	in the amhello example.  Remove statements about the need for the

	depend2.am: fix comments on verbosity of compilation rules

	The situation and decisions described on those comments have become
	quite outdated since the introduction of the silent-rules support.
	Today, the general idea is to have nice, terse output if silent rules
	are enabled, and complete, faithful, very verbose output if they are
	not -- without trying to "massage" this verbose output in a more
	pleasant form if that would cause complication in the affected code.

	So it's better to just drop the obsolescent comments.

	Note that we don't start simplifying the existing rules according
	to this new philosophy; that will only be done when touching some
	existing code (for the 'depend2.am' code, that will probably happen
	on the master branch).

	coverage: compile rules used "-c -o" also with losing compilers

	If the 'subdir-objects' option is used, Automake-generated rules for
	C compilation pass both the "-c" and "-o" options to the C compiler,
	*unconditionally*.  There are some compilers that choke on such an
	usage, but the AM_PROG_CC_C_O macro takes care of them (it does so by
	redefining $CC to use the Automake-provided 'compile' wrapper script
	automatically, if a losing compiler is detected at configure runtime).

	Unfortunately, in case the 'subdir-objects' option is specified in a
	Makefile.am, but all the source files resided anyway in the top-level
	directory (relative to the Makefile.am), Automake do *not* complain
	if AM_PROG_CC_C_O wasn't invoked in 'configure.ac' -- all the while
	still passing "-c -o" to the compiler invocations.  This could cause
	compilation failures with losing compilers if the user forget to call
	AM_PROG_CC_C_O in 'configure.ac' (and Automake would not warn him of
	the issue).

	Expose this bug in the testsuite.

	Issue identified by Nick Bowler in the discussion on automake bug#13378:
	<http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=13378#35>

	texi: no longer support split info files

	See automake bug#13351 and bug#12320.

	Automake-generated recipes have for a long time supported "split"
	info files:

	  http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/texinfo.html#Tag-and-Split-Files

	When I asked the rationale for this feature:

	  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/texinfo-devel/2012-08/msg00015.html

	Karl Berry confirmed that the reason for its existence was indeed
	"efficiency, especially memory size":

	  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/texinfo-devel/2012-08/msg00024.html

	He also added that "The Elisp manual is one of the largest ones around.
	Looks like it would be maybe 3.5mb as one file."  Not in any way big by
	modern standards.

	OTOH, it appears that the use of split info files (at least in the way
	they have been handled by Automake-generated rules for a long time) can
	cause real problems in some (admittedly quite corner-case) situations:

	  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.parsers.bison.bugs/3963
	  http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12320

	So we now follow suit with Automake-NG (see commit v1.12.2-901-gdd603e2,
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-ng/2012-08/msg00147.html>)
	and have Automake-generated makefiles pass the '--no-split' option
	unconditionally to makeinfo invocations.

	This allow some nice simplifications in our Texinfo recipes, and offer
	an automatic fix for bug#12320.

	Another *very* good aspect of such a change is that it should be 100%
	transparent to the Automake users.

	* lib/am/texinfos.am: Simplify moderately.
	* lib/am/texibuild.am: Simplify greatly the recipe for the creation
	of info files.
	* t/txinfo-makeinfo-error-no-clobber.sh: Adjust.
	* t/txinfo-no-split.sh: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

	Can be done like this:

	        dist-info:
	            @:

	Note that this usage is not yet documented: we might decide to go
	for a fully-fledged 'no-dist-info' flag, or something like that, in
	future automake version (this is not yet decided); in which case,
	it's better not to have people start to rely on the hack above.
	Still, there's no good reason to break it gratuitously, hence this
	test coverage.

	plans: add the "PLANS" directory

	Individual files or sub-directories about future and on-going
	development plans in Automake will be added in follow-up commits.

	This new set of documents is meant to help ensure a more controlled
	and smooth development and evolution for Automake, in several ways.

	 - Having the plans clearly spelled out should will avoid messy
	   roadmaps with no clear way forward or with muddy or ill-defined
	   aims or purposes; a trap this is too easy to fall into.

	 - Keeping planned changes cooking and re-hashed for a while should
	   ensure rough edges are smoothed up, transitions are planned in a
	   proper way (hopefully avoiding debacles like the AM_MKDIR_PROG_P
	   deprecation and the AM_CONFIG_HEADER too-abrupt removal), and
	   "power users" have more chances of getting informed in due time,
	   thus having all the time to prepare for the changes or raise
	   objections against them.

	 - Having the plans clearly stated and registered in a "centralized"
	   location should make it more difficult to them to slip through
	   the cracks, getting forgotten or (worse) only half-implemented.

	 - Even for discussions and plans registered on the Bug Tracker
	   as well, a corresponding entry in the PLANS directory can help
	   in keeping main ideas summarized, and consensus and/or objections
	   registered and easily compared.

	Motivation:
	<http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2013/01/autotools-mythbuster-automake-pains>
	Not a flatting picture for us (and maybe a little too harsh), but
	basically true and even spot-on in some regards.

	docs: re-introduce mention of two-args AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE invocation

	Albeit obsolescent and raising warnings in the 'obsolete' category,
	that usage is still supported, and will need to be until Autoconf
	improves its handling of configure-time-generated package version
	numbers.  So it's better to explicitly document it again, stating
	that it is obsoleted but still working (and why), rather then leaving
	it as Yet Another Undocumented Feature (that will mysteriously and
	suddenly break some random day in the future).

	It's worth giving some background about how we ended up in the
	situation that this patch fixes.

	We had originally removed support for the long-deprecated two-args
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE invocation (see commit v1.12-67-ge186355).  Before
	that removal could land in a released Automake version, Bob Friesenhahn
	made a quite compelling point that the two-args AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
	invocation could still be useful for modern, maintained packages like
	GraphicsMagick, at least until Autoconf is fixed to offer better support
	for "dynamic" package versions (see commit v1.12.2-245-g2abe183 for more
	in-depth rationales and references).  However, in that commit we didn't
	revert the removal of the *documentation* for this two-arguments
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE invocation (and no rationale for not doing so was given
	in the commit message).  Time to remedy that.

	Indirectly suggested by Diego Elio Pattenò:

	texi: deprecate hack about info files in CLEANFILES variables

	For quite a long time, Automake has been implementing an undocumented
	hack which ensured that '.info' files which appeared to be cleaned (by
	e.g. being listed in the CLEANFILES or DISTCLEANFILES variables) were
	built in the builddir rather than in the srcdir; this hack was introduced
	to ensure better backward-compatibility with packages such as Texinfo,
	which did things like:

	    info_TEXINFOS = texinfo.txi info-stnd.texi info.texi
	    DISTCLEANFILES = texinfo texinfo-* info*.info*
	    # Do not create info files for distribution.
	    dist-info:
	        @:

	in order not to distribute .info files.

	Now that we have the 'info-in-builddir' option that explicitly causes
	generated '.info' files to be placed in the builddir, this hack should
	be longer necessary, so we deprecate it with runtime warnings.  It is
	scheduled to be removed altogether in Automake 1.14.

	* automake.in (handle_texinfo_helper): Raise proper runtime warnings
	if the hack is triggered.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* t/txinfo28.sh: Adjust.

	texi: info files can be generated in the builddir

	User can now ask info files to be built in the $(builddir), rather than
	the $(srcdir), by specifying the Automake option 'info-in-builddir'.
	This feature was requested by the developers of GCC, GDB, GNU binutils
	and the GNU bfd library.  See the extensive discussion about automake
	bug#11034 for more details.

	OK, to be honest, having '.info' files built in the builddir was
	*already* possible, but only using ugly and undocumented hacks involving
	definition of the CLEANFILES and/or DISTCLEANFILES.  For example, the
	binutils project did something like this in the relevant 'Makefile.am':

	    # Automake 1.9 will only build info files in the objdir if they are
	    # mentioned in DISTCLEANFILES.  It doesn't have to be unconditional,
	    # though, so we use a bogus condition.
	    if GENINSRC_NEVER
	    DISTCLEANFILES = binutils.info
	    endif

	See also the extensive discussion about automake bug#11034; in
	particular, the following messages:
	<http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=11034#65>

	tests: don't always look for a C++ compiler named 'RCC'

	On MacOS X (10.8), since the file system is case-insensitive, RCC
	can point to the "Resource Compiler" of the Qt4 Toolkit:

	    <http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.2/rcc.html>

	That mismatch causes our configure script to erroneously think that
	no working C++ compiler is present, and that is thus necessary to
	skip all the test cases requiring such a compiler.

	So only look for a compiler named 'RCC' if the file system is
	case-sensible.

	In Automake 1.13, the long-deprecated (since 2002) macro AM_PROG_CC_STDC
	has been removed.  Such a removal, albeit sensible and justified, was
	probably done in a too-abrupt way, since it didn't turn the pre-existing
	warning messages into fatal error messages, but simply dropped the macro
	definition, so that remaining usages of it would cause unclear error
	messages, e.g.:

	    configure.ac:4: warning: macro 'AM_PROG_CC_STDC' not found in library

	from aclocal, and:

	the removal was done without a proper deprecation period, and that
	caused packages upgrading to Automake 1.13 to fail with very unclear
	error messages, e.g.:

	    configure.ac:4: warning: macro 'AM_CONFIG_HEADER' not found in library

	from aclocal, and:

	    configure.ac:4: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_CONFIG_HEADER
	      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
	      See the Autoconf documentation.

	from autoconf.

	In an attempt to mitigate this issue, we re-add an AM_CONFIG_HEADER
	definition that simply raises a *clear* error message when the macro
	is used.

2012-12-29  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	cleanup: get rid of 'Automake::Configure_ac' module

	Now that we unconditionally assume the Autoconf input is named
	"configure.ac", it's easier and clearer to inline the checks on
	the existence of such a file directly in the automake and
	aclocal scripts.

	This change is basically a backport of the 'v1.12-327-gee6d72a'
	commit from Automake-NG.

	compile: remove support for $(INCLUDES)

	It has already been deprecated in the manual and by warnings in the
	'obsolete' category for ages (at least since 2003), in favour of
	AM_CPPFLAGS.  Automake-NG has removed support for it already.  And
	the warnings in the obsolete category are on by default since the
	1.12.4 release.

	So, by removing it in Automake 1.14, we will simplify the transition
	path for people that want to switch to Automake-NG.

	See also Automake-NG commit v1.12-267-g6b74968 of 2012-05-21,

	  aclocal: allow third-party macros take precedence over automake ones

2012-12-28  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	aclocal: allow third-party macros take precedence over automake ones

	It makes sense to allow "local system-wide" m4 macros take precedence
	over built-in macros (defined in the aclocal versioned m4 directory
	"${prefix}/share/aclocal-${APIVERSION}"), the same way we allow
	"environment-level" m4 macros (through the ACLOCAL_PATH environment
	variable ) take precedence over system-wide third-party macros.

	An example: after this change, a definition of AM_PROG_VALAC placed
	in file (say) '/usr/local/share/aclocal/my-vala.m4' should take
	precedence over the same-named automake-provided macro defined in
	file '/usr/local/share/aclocal-1.14/vala.m4'.

	Even more importantly, after this change, m4 macros accessible
	through $ACLOCAL_PATH entries will take precedence over m4 macros
	defined in the aclocal versioned m4 directory; it was quite counter
	intuitive that it was not the case before.

	ylwrap: various fixes

	Rename properly header guards in generated header files, instead of
	leaving Y_TAB_H.

	Convert header guards in implementation files.  Because ylwrap failed
	to rename properly #include in the implementation files, current
	versions of Bison (e.g., 2.7) duplicate the generated header file in
	the implementation file.  The header guard then protects the
	implementation file from duplicate definitions from the header file.

	Generate header guards with a single '_' for series of non alphabetic
	characters, instead of several.  This is what Bison does.

	Makes the test t/yacc-d-basic.sh pass again.

	* HACKING: The announcement should be generate *before* bumping
	the version number to the next alpha number.  Also, only an
	abridged version of the announcement should be copied on the
	Savannah news feed (a link to the complete announcement should
	be linked from there, though).

2012-12-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	fixup: add dummy rule for ChangeLog generation in Makefile.am

	So that automake won't complain about the missing ChangeLog.
	The real rule for ChangeLog generation is now in maint.mk (as
	it is maintainer-specific).

	* Makefile.am (ChangeLog): Dummy.

2012-12-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	and refactorings while at it.

2012-12-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maint: move maintainer make rules in maint.mk

	This is done for two reasons:

	  1. It will enable us to take advantage of more GNU make
	     features in our maintainer-specific recipes, if we
	     want to (and we probably will).

	  2. The Makefile.am won't have to be modified each time a
	     maintainer rule needs to be changed or tweaked; this
	     will prevent useless remaking of (in particular) the
	     't/testsuite-part.am' file.

	* maint.mk: New, several recipes, rules and variables for
	maintainer-specific tasks, extracted (with some tweaks)
	from ...
	* Makefile.am: ... this file.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add 'maint.mk'.
	* GNUmakefile: Include 'maint.mk' after 'Makefile'.

2012-12-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Just a minor refactoring to reduce duplication; no semantic change is

	* Makefile.am (web_manual_dir): New.

2012-12-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	maint: rename rules to build/upload web manuals

	The new names are the same used by the similar-purpose rules provided by
	the 'top/maint.mk' makefile in gnulib (as of commit v0.0-7741-g4a8c422).
	No need to have gratuitous incompatibilities.

	* Makefile.am (web-manuals): Rename ...
	(web-manual): ... like this.
	(upload-web-manuals): Rename ...
	(web-manual-update): ... like this.
	(clean-web-manuals): Rename ...
	(clean-web-manual): ... like this.

2012-12-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2012-12-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	docs: build the web manuals for CVS in the builddir, not in the srcdir

	We can do so using the '-I' option of the gendocs.sh script.

	Inspired by the 'web-manual' rule in the 'top/maint.mk' file provided
	by gnulib (as of commit v0.0-7741-g4a8c422) as customized by Bison in
	its 'cfg.mk' file (as of commit v2.6.5-1007-gf5fceda).

	* Makefile.am (web-manuals): Modify and simplify to take advantage
	of gendocs.sh's  '-I' option.
	(upload-we-manuals): Accordingly adjust sanity checks and the rsync
	invocation in the recipe.
	(clean_texinfo_clutter_cmd): Delete this variable, it's no longer
	required.
	(clean-texinfo-clutter): Delete this phony target, it's no longer
	required.
	(clean-local): Don't depend on it.
	* configure.ac: Invoke AC_PROG_LN_S, since we want to use $(LN_S)
	in the new 'web-manuals' recipe.

2012-12-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	release: automate uploading of web manuals in CVS

	This is partly inspired to the 'gnu-web-doc-update' script from
	gnulib.  Unfortunately, we can't use that script directly, because
	as of now it assumes a build system integrated with gnulib.

	* Makefile.am (upload-web-manuals): New .PHONY rule.
	(RSYNC, CVS, CVSU, CVS_USER, WEBCVS_ROOT): New variables, used by
	the new rule.

	tests: avoid two spurious failures on FreeBSD

	Due to the FreeBSD make bug that causes of the well-known automake
	bug#7884, two of our bison-requiring tests were failing on FreeBSD.
	To avoid this, simply skip the part of these tests affected by that
	bug.

	* t/yacc-bison-skeleton.sh: Here, using the 'yl_distcheck' function.
	* t/yacc-bison-skeleton-cxx.sh: Likewise.
	* t/yacc-nodist.sh: While at it, use the 'yl_distcheck' here
	as well, instead of running "$MAKE distcheck" only when $MAKE
	is GNU make.

2012-12-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: improve 'pkg-config' requirement

	This improves (and unifies among different tests) the detection of
	both the 'pkg-config' program and m4 macros provided by it; they are
	needed in particular by tests on Vala support.

	Before this, some Vala-related tests were failing spuriously when the
	pkg-config program was available but the macros from pkg.m4 were not
	made explicitly available in ACLOCAL_PATH.  These tests were:

	    vala-mix vala-mix2 vala-parallel vala-vapi vala-vpath

	See also similar commit 'v1.11-581-gb7d67d5' of 2011-12-22,
	"tests: better handling of gettext and libtool requirements".

	* t/ax/am-test-lib.sh (process_requirements): If a requirement
	matches the 'pkg-config*' wildcard, try to make available to it
	the pkg-config m4 macros, and skip it if it's not possible.
	This is done by sourcing the 'get.sh' fragment generated by ...
	* t/pkg-config-macros.sh: ... this new test, which looks in
	advance for the 'pkg-config' program and the m4 macros that
	comes with it.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add the new test.
	* gen-testsuite-part (%deps_extractor): Tests requiring pkg-config
	will need the m4 macros coming with it; so these tests should be
	run after the 'pkg-config-macros.sh' test.  Automatically generate
	proper declarations for such dependencies.
	* t/vala-header.sh: No need to explicitly check that the macro
	PKG_CHECK_MODULES has been expanded by autoconf.
	* t/vala-libs.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala-non-recursive-setup.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala-per-target-flags.sh: Likewise.

	depcomp: remove 'icc' depmode, add 'tcc' one

	According to the comments in the now-removed test 'depcomp5.test' (removed
	by commit 'v1.11-1829-g5066c1b' of 2012-02-08, "tests: improve and rework
	tests on dependency tracking") "icc 8.0 and greater understand gcc options,
	so depmode is set to gcc".  According to Wikipedia, the 8.0 version of the
	Intel C compiler has been released in December 2003, that is, almost nine
	yeas ago.  So we can remove explicit support for icc 7.x from the depcomp
	script.

	Since our support for tcc has so far been relied on the icc depmode, we
	must write a new explicit 'tcc' depmode.  That is easy to do, since we can
	rely on the simpler and better-specified format of tcc-specified makefiles;

2012-11-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	python: make installed modules find by default on Debian and Ubuntu

	This change fixes automake bug#10227.

	The code used to get the python package directory was wrong for Python 3,
	at least on Debian and Ubuntu distributions.  In the case the installation
	was using the default prefix "/usr/local", python modules were incorrectly
	installed in the directory

	    /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages

	(which is *not* searched by default), rather than in a directory like

	    /usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages

	which is searched by default.

	possible, for better interactions with python 3.x.

	tests: avoid a failure due to m4 builtin 'sinclude' in package name

	Even with Autoconf 2.69, AC_INIT is not very robust when to package

	    $ echo 'AC_INIT([dnl], [1.0])' | autoconf -o/dev/null -

	tests: AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS: ignore inevitable failures with old autoconf

	When "older" version of autoconf are used (that is, those before commit
	v2.69-44-g1ed0548), we have no sane way to prevent the autom4te invocation
	issued from aclocal to possibly display warnings "MACRO m4_require'd but
	not m4_defun'd".  That's not a big deal, because that just means that
	people using pre-2.70 autoconf with cutting-edge automake will see few
	spurious warnings, but the actual semantics will remain correct.

	However, this blemish was causing a couple of annoying testsuite failures.
	Solve this by simply skipping the affected tests when older (pre-2.70)
	autoconf versions are used.

	recursion: remove _AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS indirection

	Since automake automatically smashes extra whitespace and newlines
	in the arguments of the macros it traces, we can remove the extra
	indirection with the _AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS.  This doesn't
	truly simplify the existing code, but make it slightly easier to
	understand anyway, since leave it with one less indirection.

	* automake.in: Trace AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS directly, rather
	than tracing _AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS.  Remove trailing and
	leading empty fields in the extracted arguments.

	aclocal: AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS: work around autom4te option parsing bugs

	The autom4te program coming with autoconf 2.68 and earlier had a bug
	which caused the "-" command line argument (with which we tell it to
	read some input from from standard input) to aways be pushed at the
	*end* of the command line, regardless of where the user specified it
	(that bug was fixed by autoconf commit 'v2.68-120-gf4be358', "getopt:
	new Autom4te::Getopt module").

	This broken semantics conflict with our usage in aclocal, where we
	need to pass some input to the invoked autom4te program early, and
	have so far been using the stdin to do so.  Now we start using an
	external file instead.

	* m4/internal/ac-config-macro-dirs.m4: New file, contain a fallback
	definition of the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS macro for older autoconf
	releases.
	* aclocal.in (trace_used_macros): When invoking autom4te, use that
	file instead of "abusing" standard input.
	* Makefile.am (dist_automake_ac_DATA): Rename ...
	(nobase_dist_automake_ac_DATA): ... like this.
	Add 'm4/internal/ac-config-macro-dirs.m4' to it.

	need for the user to add ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am.  For example,
	before this change, in order to have aclocal look for macros in 'm4/dir1'
	and 'm4/dir2' also when (say) autoconf 2.69 was used, our users would
	have had to add something like:

	    ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4/dir1 -I m4/dir2

	in Makefile.am, in addition to the

	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([m4/dir1 m4/dir2])

	in configure.ac.  Now, the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS call is enough.

	See the long-winded discussion on automake bug#12845 for more details:
	<http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12845>

	* aclocal.in ($ac_config_macro_dirs_fallback): New global variable,
	contains m4 code to issue a fallback definition of AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS
	as an alias for the private macro _AM_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS.
	(trace_used_macros): Handle and trace that macro.  Do some code
	reorganization and fix related botched indentation while at it.
	(write_aclocal): Output '$ac_config_macro_dirs_fallback' early in
	the generated aclocal.m4.

	autoconf.
	* t/subpkg-macrodir.sh: Likewise.

	aclocal: avoid spurious warnings from autom4te with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS

	When some macro expanded in configure.ac calls AC_REQUIRE on another
	macro that is defined in one of the local m4 macro dirs specified
	with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, aclocal prints spurious warnings like:

	    configure.ac:4: warning: MY_BAR is m4_require'd but not m4_defun'd
	    configure.ac:3: MY_FOO is expanded from...

	Such warnings come from autom4te, and are due to the fact that the
	*first* autom4te invocation issued by aclocal is not yet able to
	"see" the m4 macro definitions in the local m4 dirs (because they
	can be looked for only after the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS call has been
	traced, and tracing it requires running autom4te).

	To allow us to work around this issue, autom4te has introduced a new
	"witness" macro 'm4_require_silent_probe', that, when defined, allows
	us to silence that particular kind of warnings (and only it).

	Reported by Nick Bowler; see point (4) of:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2012-11/msg00000.html>

	aclocal: smash newlines in arguments of traced macros

	This change fixes the existing issues with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS
	containing newlines:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2012-11/msg00000.html>

	Likely, it will also allow a less involved implementation of the
	AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS macro (but that is left for potential
	follow-up patches).

	* aclocal.in (trace_used_macros): When calling autom4te, pass its
	'--trace' option an argument containing '${::}%' rather than '$1'.
	According to the autoconf manual (as of version 2.69), that will expand
	to the concatenation, with the '::' string, of all the arguments passed
	to a macro, with all newline characters in such arguments smashed.
	Related adjustments when handling the macro AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, to
	ensure leading whitespace in its argument are handled correctly.
	* t/aclocal-macrodirs.tap ("AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS: extra whitespace"):
	No longer declare it as an xfailing test.

	* t/aclocal-macrodirs.tap: Enhance to check use of extra whitespaces
	and newline characters in the arguments to AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS.  This

	aclocal: diagnose non-existing directories in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS better

	This new implementation ensures that any directory (possibly excluding
	the first one, if the '--install' option is used) that is declared with
	AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS and that is non-existent will cause an error from
	aclocal.

	* aclocal.in (scan_m4_dirs): Add a new argument, telling whether it's OK
	for the scanned directory to be non-existing.  Adjust the implementation
	accordingly.
	($first_user_m4dir): Remove, no more needed.
	(scan_m4_files): Update 'scan_m4_dirs' invocations so that aclocal will
	not complain if the first user macro directory is non-existing and the
	'--install' option is given: such directory will be created later by
	aclocal itself.
	* t/aclocal-macrodir.tap: Do not mark the last test as TODO anymore;
	it now passes.  Make stricter by ensuring a non-existing directory in
	AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS causes an hard error, not a warning.

2012-11-10  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	aclocal: multiple local m4 macro dirs with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS

	A new macro 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS' has been recently introduced in
	autoconf (and is expected to appear in the autoconf 2.70 release),
	allowing us to declare several local m4 macro directories for a
	package.

	It can be done either passing several arguments to a single invocation:

	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([dir1 dir2])

	or issuing more invocations:

	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([dir1])
	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([dir2])

	or a combination of the two:

	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([dir1 dir2])
	    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([dir3])

	This will allow projects to use several m4 macro local dirs, without the
	need to use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS (which we want to make obsolete and finally
	remove).  This is especially important for projects that are used as
	nested subpackages of larger projects.

	For more information and rationales, refer to these past discussions:

	tests: remove mostly-redundant tests on silent rules

	We used to have several couples of tests named like 'silent-foo-gcc.sh'
	and 'silent-foo-generic.sh'.  Differently from what the names suggest,
	the first test in such a couple (that is, "silent-foo-gcc.sh") was not
	meant to check specific GCC-related features, but rather to check how
	the silent rules behave in combination with automatic dependency tracking
	when the 'gcc' depmode (that targets GCC versions before the 3.x and 4.x
	release series) is forced.

	Such depmode forcing was done exclusively to cover the code paths in
	'lib/am/depend2.am' that actually invoke the 'depcomp' script, rather
	than using the inlined, GCC-specific compiler invocation (the so-called
	"fastdep" mode), which is the default with modern GCC or with other
	modern compilers that can emulate the GCC command-line interface (e.g.,
	clang 3.0).

	But whenever we run the silent-*-generic.sh" tests with other supported
	compilers which have an associated depmode different from 'gcc3', these
	same "non-fastdep" code paths are covered, since in those tests we run
	./configure with the '--enable-dependency-tracking' option, which causes
	slower depmodes not to be rejected.  Examples of such compilers are the
	Sun C and C++ compilers (at least since version 5.9, a.k.a. Sun Studio
	12.1), and the Tiny C Compiler (from version 0.9.26); and I run the
	Automake testsuite quite regularly with those compilers.

	So, the "silent-*-gcc.sh" test cases don't offer any real coverage
	enhancements, while still using testsuite runtime and causing some
	(admittedly minor, but still annoying) synchronization headaches with
	the sister tests "silent-foo-general.sh" tests.  So let's just remove
	these "silent-*-gcc.sh" tests.

	tests: can check our recipes avoid trailing backslashes

	This is related to commit v1.11-1704-g254227b of 2012-05-01,
	"parallel-tests: avoid trailing backslashes in make recipes",
	and automake bug#10436.

	Recipes with a trailing backslash character (possibly followed by
	blank characters only) can cause spurious syntax errors with at
	least older bash versions (e.g., bash 2.05b), and can be potentially

	the known shells that are good enough to run the automake testsuite
	do automatically exit with error when a sourced file cannot be found

	AM_PROG_MKDIR_P: remove as obsolete, this time for good

	This commit basically reverts v1.12.4-158-gdf23daf, re-instating
	commit v1.12-20-g8a1c64f.

	Support for the obsolescent 'AM_PROG_MKDIR_P' m4 macro has been
	deprecated in the documentation and with runtime warnings since
	Automake 1.12.1.  Still, when we released Automake 1.13, we had
	to delay that macro's removal, since at the time the last released
	version of GNU gettext still AC_REQUIRE's AM_PROG_MKDIR_P via its
	'intl.m4' and 'po.m4' files, which are pulled into *many* projects.

	But it's now time to remove AM_PROG_MKDIR_P once and for all.
	Projects still needing to work with older gettext releases will
	be able to do so by adding a definition like

	   AC_DEFUN([AM_PROG_MKDIR_P], [AC_PROG_MKDIR_P([$@])])

	to their 'acinclude.m4' file or to another local '*.m4' file.

	* m4/mkdirp.m4: Delete.
	* Makefile.am (dist_automake_ac_DATA): Remove it.
	* automake.in (scan_autoconf_traces): Don't handle, nor warn about,
	AM_PROG_MKDIR_P.
	* doc/automake.texi (Obsolete Macros): Delete (it only spoke about
	AM_PROG_MKDIR_P).
	* t/gettext-macros.sh: Adjust.
	* t/mkdirp-deprecation.sh: Delete.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Don't list it.

	tests: prepare to move ./defs to t/ax/test-init.sh

	We don't do this in a sweeping passage, because that would cause
	endless headaches in the synchronization between the maint, master
	and ng/master branches.  Instead, we setup our framework to allow
	test scripts to work by sourcing either './defs' or 'test-init.sh',
	so that we'll be able to make the transition gradual and painless.

	* t/ax/test-init.sh: New, copied from the previous ./defs file.
	* defs: Simply work by sourcing the new file.

	triggering harder-to-diagnose fallout failures in later steps.

	For a precedent of a similar behaviour, see the AC_PROG_YACC macro.

	vala: AM_PROG_VALAC should not produce an error for tool-old valac

	This change fixes automake bug#12688.

	In the AM_PROG_VALAC macro, when the optional parameter specifying the
	minimum release number is not provided, and/or if the Vala compiler is
	not found, then there is a _warning_ message.

	On the other hand, when the version number is specified and if the Vala
	compiler is too old, there is an _error_ message.

	This error message is problematic, because for a tarball, the Vala
	compiler is not required: the generated C code is included in the
	tarball.  So if a user wants to compile the software, he shouldn't
	need the valac program with the right version.

	of AC_MSG_ERROR.

	tests: ensure generation of wrapper tests matching multiple conditions

	* gen-testsuite-part: Our old code to generate wrapper tests had a
	severe limitation, in that if a test matched two or more conditions
	calling for generation of wrapper tests, still only one wrapper test
	was generated, instead of the three that would have been expected --
	that is, one using the setup code triggered by the first condition,
	one using the setup code triggered by the second condition, and one
	using both this setup code fragments.
	Admittedly, this was only a theoretical limitation for the moment,
	since since so far no test exists that matches two or more conditions
	for wrapping.  Still, this might change in the future, and easily in
	an unnoticed way, so better fix the issue now, before it might become
	a real problem.

	compile: support libfoo.a naming when wrapping Microsoft tools

	There is a future plan to provide some means to have Automake
	create static libraries that are named differently depending
	on the system [1].

	The background is that everyone has always named static libraries
	libfoo.a, except the Redmond crowd who names them foo.lib, and
	you have to jump through hoops to have Automake create libraries
	named foo.lib in the land of non-GNU Windows while still creating
	libfoo.a everywhere else.

	However, there is probably no sane way to accomplish that system
	dependent naming discussed in [1] without user intervention,
	which makes it necessary to support the classic libfoo.a naming
	when using Microsoft tools in the best possible way, for the
	benefit of all projects today and for future projects not
	opting in to whatever scheme is selected for the problem at
	hand.

	[1] http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2012-09/msg00028.html

	config headers: don't emit rules for headers not generated by autoheader

	This change fixed automake bug#12495.

	Even if an AC_CONFIG_HEADERS invocation is passed a list of several files
	as the first argument, only the first one of those file is considered by
	autoheader for automatic generation of the corresponding '.in' template.
	This is done on purpose, and is clearly documented in the Autoconf manual,
	which (as of the 2.69 version) reads something like this:

	    The autoheader program searches for the first invocation of
	    AC_CONFIG_HEADERS in configure sources to determine the name of
	    the template.  If the first call of AC_CONFIG_HEADERS specifies
	    more than one input file name, autoheader uses the first one.

	That is, an invocation like:

	    AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h config2.h])

	should cause autoheader to generate only a 'config.h.in' template,
	and not also a 'config2.h.in' one.

	Accordingly, automake, when tracing AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, should generate
	remake rules only for the template associated to the first input file
	name passed to that macro.  In some situations, however, automake failed
	to properly limit itself in this way; for example, with an input like:

	    AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h sub/foo.h])

	in configure.ac, and with the 'sub' directory listed in the SUBDIRS
	variable of the top-level Makefile, automake would erroneously generate
	in 'sub/Makefile.in' a rule to remake the 'foo.h.in' template by
	invoking autoheader.

	This issue was likely introduced in commit 'Release-1-8-23-g262bb92'
	of 2004-01-05.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* doc/automake.texi (Optional): Improve wording in the description of
	hat rules automake generates in response to an 'AC_CONFIG_HEADERS'
	invocation.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am: Only emit autoheader-invoking remake rules for
	the %CONFIG_HIN% template if that corresponds to the first argument of
	AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, as explaned above.  Do so using the automake-time
	conditional %?FIRST-HDR%, that is properly passed ...
	* automake.in (handle_configure): ... from a 'file_contents' invocation
	in here.
	* t/autohdr-subdir-pr12495.sh: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE: allow obsolescent two-args invocation once again

	This partially reverts commit 'v1.12-67-ge186355' of 2012-05-25,
	"init: obsolete usages of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE not supported anymore"

	Some users still need to be able to define the version number for
	their package dynamically, at configure runtime.

	Their user case is that, for development snapshots, they want to be
	able to base the complete version of the package on the VCS revision
	ID (mostly Git or Mercurial).  They could of course do so by
	specifying such version dynamically in their call to AC_INIT, as is
	done by several GNU packages.  But then they would need to regenerate
	and re-run the configure script before each snapshot, which might be
	very time-consuming for complex packages, to the point of slowing
	down and even somewhat impeding development.

	The situation should truly be solved in Autoconf, by allowing a way
	to specify the version dynamically in a way that doesn't force the
	configure script to be regenerated and re-run every time the package
	version changes.  But until Autoconf has been improved to allow
	this, Automake will have to support the obsolescent two-arguments
	invocation for AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, to avoid regressing the suboptimal
	but working solution for the use case described above.

	with the /bin/sh shell from NetBSD 5.1.  This was actually causing the

	* t/vala-vapi.sh: Use 'printf', not 'echo', to print strings containing
	substrings like '\n', that can be interpreted like escape strings.  That
	because the /bin/sh and the /bin/bash shell from OpenIndiana actually
	interpret them that way:

	  $ /bin/sh -c 'echo "foo\nbar"'
	  foo
	  bar
	  $ /bin/bash -c 'echo "foo\nbar"'
	  foo
	  bar

2012-08-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: avoid spurious failure of 't/uninstall-fail.sh' on OpenIndiana

	On current OpenIndiana (based on what once was OpenSolaris 11), the shell
	/bin/sh (which, differently from what happens on Solaris, is a true POSIX
	shell, thus worthy of consideration) somehow manages to "eat" the
	error message from 'rm' when that fails to remove a file due to lacking
	permission on the parent directory:

	  $ /bin/sh -c "cd unwritable-dir || { echo OOPS; exit 1; }; rm -f foo"
	  $ echo rc = $?
	  rc = 1
	  $ /bin/bash -c "cd unwritable-dir || { echo OOPS; exit 1; }; rm -f foo"
	  rm: foo not removed: Permission denied
	  $ echo rc = $?
	  rc = 2
	  $ /bin/sh -c "cd unwritable-dir || { echo OOPS; exit 1; }; env rm -f foo"
	  rm: foo not removed: Permission denied
	  $ echo rc = $?
	  rc = 2

	That is probably due to an improper optimization, that is, the shell tries
	to be smart and remove the file itself instead of invoking 'rm', but fails
	spectacularly in the attempt.

	* t/uninstall-fail.sh: The just-described bug was causing a spurious
	failure in this test case.  Cater to thus situation, by relaxing the
	test when a faulty shell is detected.  And while at it, fix and improve
	an unrelated comment.

	tests: reimplement wrappers for automake and aclocal in perl

	This will allow us to avoid one extra shell invocation per automake
	and aclocal invocation in our testsuite, and, more importantly, will
	allow us not to worry about potential shell portability issues, at
	least in those wrappers.  For an example of such a portability issue,
	refer to the recent commit v1.12.2-80-g65dadf6 "tests: work around a
	ksh bug w.r.t. ${1+"$@"}".

	Fixes automake bug#10898.  See also the older (much older) thread:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2009-12/msg00036.html>

	At least the AT&T and OpenSolaris versions of the Korn shell, as well
	as the /bin/sh from OpenIndiana 11, have a strange bug regarding the
	expansion of ${1+"$@"}: when exactly *one empty* argument is passed to
	a script run by one of this shells, inside that script ${1+"$@"} will
	expand to *nothing*, rather than to to the single empty string, as
	one would expect (OTOH, $# will correctly expand to 1).  This buggy
	behaviour was causing a spurious failure in our testsuite (test 6 in
	't/automake-cmdline.tap').  Work around it.

	tests: simplify sourcing of helper shell files

	Now that the early $PATH setup in both 'runtest' and AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT
	allow the '.' built-in to find to-be-sourced shell scripts in the 't/ax/'
	directory automatically, we can simplify several usages like:

	   . "$am_testauxdir"/foo.sh

	to just:

	   . foo.sh

	Also, because our test scripts run with the 'errexit' flag active, and
	because POSIX mandates that, when the '.' built-in is used,

	   ... if no readable file is found, a non-interactive shell shall abort ...

	we can further simplify usages like:

	    . "$am_testauxdir"/foo.sh || fatal_ "sourcing foo.sh"

	once again to to just:

	    . foo.sh

	to-be-sourced shell scripts in 't/ax' automatically, both in in-tree
	and  VPATH builds.

	tests: update PATH early from AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT and runtest

	Because the POSIX standards mandate that sourcing a file with ". FILE"
	will cause FILE (assuming it is a relative containing no slashes) to be
	looked for in PATH, such a move will allow us to simplify our sourcing
	of shell testing libraries like (currently) 't/ax/test-init.sh' and
	'defs', and to modularize and re-organize them better in the feature,
	with minimal churn.

	* runtest.in, Makefile.am (AM_TEST_ENVIRONMENT): Prepend $(abs_srcdir)/t/ax
	and $(abs_builddir)/t/ax (in that order) to PATH; do so avoiding repetition
	in the common case of non-VPATH builds.

	runtest: export $srcdir for use by the test scripts

	This is mostly a preparatory change in view of future ones.  But it
	also make the behaviour of runtest more similar to that of the test
	harness used by "make check".

	* runtest.in: Export srcdir (was already defined to '@srcdir@').

2012-07-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	gen-tests: $testdir/ax -> $testauxdir

	* gen-testsuite-part ($testauxdir): New, defined to "$testdir/ax".
	Use it throughout, for better encapsulation and less duplication.
	($auxdir): Remove as unneeded.

2012-07-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	gen-tests: less hard-coding of 't' as the test directory

	This will make life easier for us in case we decide to rename the
	testsuite directory in the future (perhaps to something like 'tests',
	which is somewhat less cryptic than the current 't').

	* gen-testsuite-part ($testdir): New variable, used throughout instead
	of hard-coding the name of the test directory to 't'.
	All the script adjusted to make proper use of '$testdir'.
	($auxdir): Move its definition earlier, for consistency with the one
	of '$testdir'.

	build: auxiliary testsuite files/scripts built by "make all"

	This will allow the developers to run a tests case by hand out of
	a newly extracted tarball simply doing:

	    $ ./configure && make
	    $ ./runtest t/the-test-case.sh

	while before this change one has to resort to:

	    $ ./configure && make && make check TESTS=
	    $ ./runtest t/the-test-case.sh

	or, with some non-GNU makes, even:

	    $ ./configure && make && make check TESTS= AM_MAKEFLAGS="TESTS="
	    $ ./runtest t/the-test-case.sh

	This come very handy sometimes, especially when doing one-shot
	debugging.  Admittedly not a big deal, but one less friction in
	the build system is always nice.

	* Makefile.am (check_SCRIPTS, dist_check_DATA, nodist_check_DATA):
	Move their content to ...
	(noinst_SCRIPTS, dist_noinst_DATA, nodist_noinst_DATA): ... these

	tests: avoid a spurious failure with Solaris /bin/sh

	The /bin/sh shell on Solaris is dumb enough not to set the exit
	status to 127 after the execution of a non-existing command is
	attempted:

	  $ /bin/sh -c 'nonesuch'; echo stat = $?
	  /bin/sh: nonesuch: not found
	  stat = 1

	This means that the missing script, when run through that shell,
	cannot discriminate between a real failure of a maintainer tool
	and a failure due to its absence.  This is not a big deal in
	practice (especially because all the 'missing' invocations in
	our Makefiles are done with $(SHELL), and that is almost surely
	set by configure to a proper POSIX shell), but was causing an
	annoying failure in our testsuite.  Fix it.

	* t/missing3.sh: If 'missing' is run with a /bin/sh shell suffering

	tests: remove t/parallel-tests-many.sh (fixes spurious failure)

	That test was checking for automake#7868 "parallel-tests and command-line
	length limit issue".  That bug is still open, and the tests was xfailing.

	What concerns us is that the test was also causing an annoying problem.
	On Solaris 10, it produced a '.log' file with two overly-long lines (more
	than 1 million characters long!) and that was causing the test harness to
	experience spurious failures, with Solaris XPG4 awk complaining that:

	 /usr/xpg4/bin/awk: line 0 (NR=734): Record too long (LIMIT: 19999 bytes)

	A little consideration shows that the bug#7868 checked by the culprit
	test cannot be solved "by accident", e.g., by another bug fix or some
	simple refactoring, so there is little added value in keeping the xfailing
	test for it, if this causes other problems (and we've seen it does).

	So we just remove the test.  In case we ever manage to fix the bug in
	mainline automake, we can copy over the similar test(s) from Automake-NG,
	which has actually managed to fix the bug (and have simpler test cases
	for it).

	* t/parallel-tests-many.sh: Delete.

	check: support colorized testsuite output by default

	Fixes automake bug#11855.

	With this change, we make the 'color-tests' option enabled by default.
	That option remains still silently accepted as a no-op, for backward
	compatibility.

	The developer of a package is still free to disable testsuite coloring on
	a per-makefile basis (by adding "AM_COLOR_TESTS = no" to the Makefile.am)
	or on a whole-project basis (by AC_SUBST'ing AM_COLOR_TESTS to "no" in
	configure.ac).  But now the user will be able to request the testsuite
	output to be colorized, if he really wants to:

	    # With GNU make:
	    make AM_COLOR_TESTS=yes check
	    # With non-GNU make:
	    make AM_COLOR_TESTS=yes AM_MAKEFLAGS=AM_COLOR_TESTS=yes check

	* NEWS: Update.
	* doc/automake.texi: Updated, and some related minor reformatting
	and rewording.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): No need to pass the transform '%COLOR%'
	when processing "check.am".
	* lib/am/parallel-tests.am: Remove use of the '%?COLOR%' transform;
	just act as if it were unconditionally TRUE.

	tags: unify recursion for tags targets with that of "usual" targets

	This change has a side effect: now any failure of the 'tags', 'ctags',
	'cscope' and 'cscopelist' targets in a subdirectory will cause the
	recursive command issued from the top directory to fail.  We believe
	that this behavioural change is not only justified by the simplification
	this patch entails, but actually offers better semantics: ignoring
	failures by default is never a good idea, and with make, the user can
	anyway order the completion of commands in the face of possible failures
	with the '-k' option.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* automake.in (%required_targets): Add keys 'cscopelist-am', 'tags-am'
	and 'ctags-am'.
	(handle_tags): Greatly simplified, the major part of the handling of

	elisp: use suffix rules, get rid of 'elisp-comp' script (mostly a rewrite)

	Motivated by automake bug#11806.

	Traditionally, automake byte-compiled emacs-lisp '.el' files by invoking
	'elisp-comp' on all of them in a bulk; this involved complex timestamping
	and file-locking logic.  It was also brittle in any slightly-unusual
	setup, because 'elisp-comp' operated by copying all of the elisp files
	to be compiled into a temporary sub-directory and compiling them in there,
	the copying the resulting byte-compile files back in the build directory.

	This patch removes all of that juggling and chicanery in favour of
	defining a much simpler '.el.elc' suffix rule.  Not only this is simpler,
	but it also interacts better with "make -jN" calls, which are becoming
	more and more common and useful on today's increasingly multicore systems.

	* Makefile.am (dist_script_DATA): Remove 'elisp-comp'.

	* doc/automake.texi: Remove references to 'elisp-comp'.

	m4: get rid of "# serial" lines

	The "#serial" lines are only considered by aclocal for the system-wide
	third-party '.m4' files, not for the Automake-provided ones.  So they
	serve no real purpose in the Automake '.m4' files.

	In addition, now that we use git and topic branches, and that we are also
	writing the Automake-NG fork, the "#serial" lines are becoming more and
	more unreliable (e.g., different version of the same file in different
	branches can easily end up having the same serial numbers).

	So let's just nuke all the "#serial" lines.  See also automake bug#11932.

	tests: don't use C instead of C++ compiler on case-insensitive platforms

	This change fixes automake bug#11893 and bug#10766.

	On at least Cygwin and Mac OS X 10.7, the file system where the system
	compilers are located can be case-insensitive, so that looking for a
	program named 'CC' might actually find the C compiler in /usr/bin/cc.

	Now, the Automake configure script looks for a C++ compiler named 'CC'
	before looking for more obvious names like c++ or g++ (that is done to
	increase testsuite "coverage in the wild", e.g., preferring, on Solaris,
	the Sun Studio C++ compiler /usr/bin/CC over the GNU C++ compiler).

	Since the checks done in AC_PROG_CXX are apparently not strict enough
	to rule out C compilers like those from GCC or Clang (which are smart
	enough to recognize if a file has a C++ extension, passing it to the
	C++ front end) the testsuite might end up using a C compiler where a
	C++ one is expected, with some subtle bad consequences.

	* configure.ac: Don't look for a C++ compiler named 'CC' if the
	"top-level" file system(s) (where /bin and /usr/bin are) are detected
	to be case-insensitive.

2012-07-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	distcheck: never make part of $(distdir) world-writable

	This fixes a locally-exploitable security vulnerability (CVE-2012-3386).

	In the 'distcheck' rule, we used to make the just-extracted (from
	the distribution tarball) $(distdir) directory and all its files and
	subdirectories read-only; then, in order to create the '_inst' and
	'_build' subdirectories in there (used by the rest of the recipe) we
	made the top-level $(distdir) *world-writable* for an instant (the
	time to create those two directories) before making it read-only
	again.

	Making that directory world-writable (albeit only briefly) introduced a
	locally exploitable race condition for those who run "make distcheck" with
	a non-restrictive umask (e.g., 022) in a directory that is accessible by
	others.  A successful exploit would result in arbitrary code execution
	with the privileges of the user running "make distcheck" -- game over.
	Jim Meyering wrote a proof-of-concept script showing that such exploit is
	easily implemented.

	This issue is similar to the CVE-2009-4029 vulnerability:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2009-12/msg00012.html>

	* lib/am/distdir.am (distcheck): Don't make $(distdir) world-writable,

	test runner: work correctly in VPATH setups

	Due to a "feature" of AC_CONFIG_FILES, because 't/ax/test-runner.in'
	is in a subdirectory, the '@srcdir@' value that is AC_SUBST'd in it
	gets tweaked to contain as much '..' components as are the directory
	components of 't/ax/test-runner'.  Because our build system operates
	in a non-recursive setup, this substitution is wrong; for example,
	the final 't/ax/test-runner' build in a VPATH builds where the source
	directory is ".." contains the line:

	    : ${srcdir='../../../t/ax'}

	instead of the expected (and correct):

	    : ${srcdir='../t/ax'}

	We solve the issue by building 't/ax/test-runner' with a Makefile
	recipe instead of config.status substitutions; this is already done
	for other testsuite-related files, like 'defs-static'.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Don't build 't/ax/test-runner'

	tests init: don't automatically re-execute tests with a POSIX shell

	I've unwittingly broken support for that feature *again* in some of
	my recent testsuite tweaking.  In this case, the re-execution code
	works correctly when the tests are executed with a POSIX shells, but
	breaks when they are invoked by an old-style Bourne shells (e.g.,
	/bin/sh on Solaris).

	It's time to face it: that feature is too much brittle, and too seldom
	used (because the Makefile takes care of running the tests with the
	correct shell anyway, so that a breakage is only experienced when
	running the tests by hand).  It just don't remain working for long, not
	when we often touch the testsuite setup (which we are going to do again
	when we'll try to move part of our testsuite framework to Gnulib, or a
	similar project).

	So, instead of trying to be extra-smart and automatically re-execute the
	tests with the correct shell, we now offer a simple wrapper script that
	the user can employ to run the test scripts with the proper shell.  And
	while we are at it, we write this wrapper to also deal with TAP tests in
	a better way, running them through the prove(1) utility, so that their
	results are correctly recognized and reported.

	* t/ax/test-runner.in: New file; the wrapper script we were talking about.

	tests: ignore minor 'recheck' regression for BSD make

	It turns out that, with NetBSD 5.1 make and FreeBSD 9 make, running
	"make recheck" two times in a row quickly fails to correctly re-run
	the failed tests in the second run.

	That issue has been introduced likely introduced in commit
	'v1.12.1-95-gd5443e4' of 20102-07-01, "parallel-tests: reimplement
	fix for bug#11791".

	Anyway, the use case that has been broken is not realistic (who is
	going to run "make recheck" two times in one second, without modifying
	any of the tests or the tested programs in the meantime?), so we believe
	the best fix is to simply work around the issue in the affected test
	cases, rather than risking to slow down or uglify the 'recheck' rule.

	in the test subdirectory of this self test wasn't smart enough to cater

	Merge branch 'aclocal-trace-macrodir'

	* aclocal-trace-macrodir:
	  aclocal: deprecate ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS, trace AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR instead

2012-07-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	aclocal: deprecate ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS, trace AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR instead

	Maintaining ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in the Makefile.am to pass extra flags
	to aclocal is (and have always been) quite of an hack.  For example,
	autoreconf is forced to grep Makefile.am to honour those flags.  But
	this is a bad obsolescent behaviour; in fact, the autotools have moved
	consistently in the past years from custom grepping of Makefile.am and
	configure.ac to tracing of m4 macro calls, which is more consistent,
	more reliable and more flexible.

	And when autoreconf is not used, the developer is forced to add *by hand*
	the flags specified by ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to the aclocal calls not triggered
	by make rebuild rules; here lie again more duplication and more chances
	for errors.

	Moreover, ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS has only two typical use cases:

	  - to instruct aclocal to look for extra macro definition in a local
	    directory (as with "ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4"); and

	  - to further instruct aclocal to copy in that local directory the
	    required third-party .m4 files found in the system-wide directory
	    (as with "ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4 --install").

	The first use case can be better covered if aclocal can instead trace and
	honours call to the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR autoconf macro; and the second
	use case shouldn't be considered really legitimate, as it is quite (and
	subtly) brittle (see automake bug#9037).

	Thus we now make aclocal trace AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR macro, and act
	accordingly.  For backward compatibility, we continue to support the
	ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS special variable (although removing any mention of it
	from the documentation).  Future Automake releases will likely start
	to warn about the use of that variable, and eventually remove support
	for it altogether.

	From a suggestion by Eric Blake.

	This is a much simplified (and IMHO saner) version of the patch series
	discussed in the threads:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2010-10/msg00045.html>
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2010-12/msg00156.html>

	* aclocal.in ($ac_config_macro_dir): New global variable.
	(trace_used_macros): Also trace the macro 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR',
	and set the '$ac_config_macro_dir' variable accordingly.
	(parse_arguments): Code for diagnosis of '--install' used without
	any user-specified include directory moved  ...
	(while (1)): .. into the main loop.  Which now also updates the
	list of user-specified include directories to include the directory
	given as argument to the call (if any) of 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR'.
	* lib/am/configure.am: Update comments.
	* NEWS: Updated.
	* doc/automake.texi: Likewise.  Also, stop advising the use of the
	'--install' in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS (see automake bug#9037 for a rationale),
	and remove any reference to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS (which is now considered
	obsolescent).
	* t/aclocal-path-install.sh: Adjust grepping check in the aclocal
	error messages.
	* t/subpkg.sh: Updated: add 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR' call to configure.ac,
	remove setting of 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS' in Makefile.am and use of aclocal

2012-07-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	recursion: support user-defined recursive targets

	The user can now define his own recursive targets that recurse
	in the directories specified in $(SUBDIRS).  That can be done by
	specifying the name of such targets in invocations of the new
	'AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS' m4 macro.

	The API goes like this:

	    $ cat configure.ac
	    AC_INIT([pkg-name], [1.0]
	    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
	    AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS([foo])
	    AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile sub/Makefile])
	    AC_OUTPUT

	    $ cat Makefile.am
	    SUBDIRS = sub
	    foo-local:
	        @echo This will be run by "make foo".

	    $ cat sub/Makefile.am
	    foo-local:
	        @echo This too will be run by a "make foo" issued either in
	        @echo the 'sub/' directory or in the top-level directory.

	Like for the "default" recursive targets (e.g., 'all' and 'check'),
	the user-defined recursive targets descend in the $(SUBDIRS) in a
	depth-first fashion, and process '.' last (unless that is explicitly
	specified in $(SUBDIRS)).

	* NEWS, doc/automake.texi: Document the new feature.
	* automake.in (@extra_recursive_targets): New global variable.
	(scan_autoconf_traces): Trace macro '_AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS'.
	(handle_user_recursion): New subroutine; among other things, it defines
	the new internal '$(am__extra_recursive_targets)' make variable, and
	the '*-am', '*-local' and '*-recursive' targets associated with the
	user-specified user recursive targets.
	(generate_makefile): Call the new subroutine.
	* lib/am/subdirs.am (am__recursive_targets): New internal make variable,
	listing all of '$(RECURSIVE_TARGETS)', '$(RECURSIVE_CLEAN_TARGETS)' and
	'$(am__extra_recursive_targets)' together.
	(AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS): Adjust the definition of this variable ...
	(.PHONY, .MAKE): ... and the list of dependencies of these special targets
	to take advantage of the new '$(am__recursive_targets)' variable.
	($(am__recursive_targets)): New targets, superseding ...
	($(RECURSIVE_TARGETS), $(RECURSIVE_CLEAN_TARGETS)): ... these, and
	inheriting their rules.  This way, the rules to handle recursion for
	built-in recursive targets (e.g., 'all', 'dvi', 'clean') and for user
	defined recursive targets are the same.
	* m4/extra-recurs.m4: New file, contain definition of new macro
	'AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS' and '_AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS'.
	These macros are basically dummy, only used for tracing by automake.

	After commit v1.12.1-91-g205c757 of 2012-06-20, "texi: require
	Texinfo >= 4.9, related enhancements", the presence of a Texinfo manual
	'manual.texi' in a subdir (say 'doc/') of a package using a recursive
	make setup would cause "make distcheck" to fail, due to the presence of
	the 'manual.t2d/' directory created by texi2dvi.  That directory would
	not be correctly removed because the 'mostlyclean' rule would run, from

	Once, for the sake of (at least) Solaris 10 /bin/sh, we had to use

	because the that shell's 'test' built-in didn't grok the '-e' option.

	Note however that we still can't use "test ! -e" in the Makefile recipes
	used in the test cases; that is because those recipes are run with the
	shell detected by 'configure', and Autoconf-generated configure scripts
	do no guarantee to find or provide a POSIX-compatible shell.

	We once used that feature in our wrapper tests; but now (and probably
	even since commit 'v1.11-1308-g375f23d' of 2011-09-08, "testsuite:

	wouldn't cause any problem now.

	tests: don't skip if $(abs_builddir) or $(abs_srcdir) contain whitespace

	We used to explicitly skip libtool and gettext tests if the absolute
	path of the builddir or of the srcdir which Automake was configured
	with contained any whitespace (or other metacharacters).

	But several other tests would spuriously fail in such an unholy setup.
	To be precise, it would cause 61 'FAIL's and 42 'ERROR's in the whole
	Automake testsuite.

	The fact that, as of today, nobody has reported any failure of this kind
	means that (thankfully) nobody is building automake with $(abs_srcdir)
	or $(abs_builddir) mangled by whitespace.  So, instead of trying to cater
	to such a broken setup consistently, we just drop the extra check in the
	libtool/gettext tests.

	In case someone will ever reports a failure due to extra whitespace in
	either $(abs_srcdir) or or $(abs_builddir), we will simply enhance our
	'configure.ac' to bail out flatly and loudly at such a setup.

	Furthermore, since we are hoping to change our preferred invocation

	With this change, the "recheck" target behaves better in the face of build
	failures related to previously failed tests.  For example, if a test is a
	compiled program that must be rerun by "make recheck", and its compilation
	fails, that test will still be rerun by further "make recheck" invocations.

	tests: simpler workaround for shells losing the exit status in exit trap

	Now that we can assume our tests are run by a decent POSIX shell, we
	can simplify our workaround aimed at having the exit status propagated
	correctly to the code in the exit trap.  Unfortunately, we cannot
	dispense with such a workaround altogether, because it's still required
	by some shells we need to support (at least Solaris 10 /bin/ksh and
	/usr/xpg4/bin/sh).

	For more information about the need of that workaround, see the entry
	about 'trap' in the section "Limitations of Shell Builtins" in the
	Autoconf manual:
	<http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#trap>

	The new workaround has been tested successfully with the following
	shells:

	  - Bash 4.1
	  - Bash 3.2
	  - Bash 3.0
	  - Bash 2.05b
	  - dash 0.5.5.1
	  - dash 0.5.2
	  - AT&T Ksh 93u (from official Debian package)
	  - MirBSD Korn Shell 40.2 (from official Debian package)
	  - Solaris 9, 10 and 11 /bin/ksh
	  - Solaris 9, 10 and 11 /usr/xpg4/bin/sh
	  - NetBSD 5.1 /bin/sh
	  - NetBSD 5.1 /bin/ksh

	* t/ax/test-init.sh (Exit): Rename ...
	(_am_exit): ... like this.
	(exit): New alias for '_am_exit'.  We cannot simply redefine 'exit'
	as a shell function, because some shells (dash 0.5.5.1, Solaris 10
	/bin/ksh and /usr/xpg4/bin/sh) do not allow it.
	(_am_exit, trap): Add extra escaping for 'exit' calls, to ensure we
	really invoke the 'exit' builtin and not our alias with the same
	name.
	* configure.ac: Check that the shell selected to run our testsuite
	supports aliases named like shell builtins.
	* t/REAMDE: Adjust.
	* All tests: Adjust, by simply using 'exit' instead of 'Exit'.
	* t/self-check-explicit-skips.sh: Adjust: the first usage of 'exit'
	after it has been redefined as an alias must be on a new line w.r.t.
	that where the alias is defined, in order for the redefinition to be

	(sc_tests_exit_not_Exit): New.

	bailed out like this:

	    $ /bin/sh t/ar.sh
	    $ t/ar.sh: syntax error at line 257: `is_newest_files=$' unexpected

	By moving all the potentially problematic code in a separate file, to

	tests: use more POSIX shell features our test scripts

	Since commit 'v1.12-36-g2d68fd9' of 2012-05-07, "configure: search a
	sturdy POSIX shell to be used in the testsuite", the shell running
	our test script is assured to be a POSIX-conforming shell, so we can
	use the more modern and flexible idioms and features that we couldn't
	use when we also aimed at compatibility with non-POSIX Bourne shells,
	like Solaris /bin/sh.

	* t/README: Suggest to use POSIX shell features liberally in test cases,
	with possible exception of Makefile recipes and configure shell code.
	* Several tests: Adjust to use more POSIX shell features; e.g., $(...)
	rather than `...`, $((...)) rather than `expr ...`, "if ! CMD; then ..."
	instead of "if CMD; then :; else ...", and so on.
	In several places, when using the 'test' built-in, prefer '-eq' over
	'=' for numeric comparisons, and prefer "grep -c PATTERN FILE" over
	"grep PATTERN FILE | wc -l".
	Throw in other low-hanging easy improvements and fixlets while we are
	at it.

	missing: do not touch timestamps; only warn for out-of-date files

	Before this change, the missing script had a twofold role:

	  - it warned the user if some required maintainer tools was missing,
	    or too old;

	  - in such a case, it tried to "fix" the timestamp of the files that
	    should have been rebuilt by that tool (without actually updating
	    the file contents, of course), to allow the build to continue.

	The second capability used to be quite useful in the days when most
	projects committed files generated by maintainer-only tools in their
	VCS repository (today the trend is not to keep such generated files
	VCS-committed anymore).  In such a setup, the "timestamp-fixing"
	capability of 'missing' was quite useful, in that it allowed users
	lacking some required maintainer tool to build from a VCS checkout
	in the face of skewed timestamps (as could have been caused by
	"cvs update" or "git checkout").

	But then, when the automatic remake rules kicked in due to the
	generated files being *actually out-of-date* (e.g., because the user
	had modified 'configure.ac' but lacked a modern-enough autoconf to
	rebuild it), that behaviour of 'missing' caused the same problem that
	plagued AM_MAINTAINER_MODE; i.e., the user would get non-dependable
	builds and inconsistent statuses of the build tree -- changes to
	source files don't reflect on generated files, and this can be very
	confusing and cause hard-to-spot errors).

	So we now believe that the best approach to deal with timestamp-related
	issues is not to have 'missing' to "automagically" try to resolve
	them (with all the risk and brittleness entailed), but rather to
	suggest those projects still keeping generated files committed in their
	VCS to provide a proper (say) 'fix-timestamp.sh' script that touches
	the timestamp of the checked-out files, to ensure no spurious rebuild
	will be triggered.  As a bonus, such a script can be more aware of the
	particularities, nooks and corner cases of a project, and thus more
	reliable than the old 'missing' script.

	An example of this approach is offered by GNU awk (release 4.0.1, Git
	tag 'gawk-4.0.1', commit b85b04e8).  The GNU awk maintainers commit
	the Autotools-generated files (configure, Makefile.in, etc.) and other
	generated in the project's Git repository, but offer a useful script
	'bootstrap.sh' that fixes the timestamps of those files, to ensure no
	useless remake is triggered in a freshly cloned repository:

	    #! /bin/sh
	    # bootstrap.sh --- touch relevant files to avoid out-of-date issues
	    #                  in Git sandboxes
	    touch aclocal.m4
	    find awklib -type f -print | xargs touch
	    sleep 1
	    touch configure
	    sleep 2
	    touch configh.in
	    sleep 1
	    touch test/Maketests
	    find . -name Makefile.in -print | xargs touch
	    touch doc/*.info
	    touch po/*.gmo
	    touch po/stamp-po
	    touch awkgram.c
	    touch command.c
	    touch version.c

	A similar, simplified script is also reported as an example in the
	manual.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* doc/automake.texi (Auxiliary Programs, maintainer-mod): Update.
	(CVS): Do not suggest that 'missing' can "automagically" fix botched
	timestamp due to a "cvs update"; this isn't true anymore.  Give an
	example of a custom 'fix-timestamp.sh' script that can be used to
	obtain the same effect (in a slightly more laborious but also more
	explicit and less brittle way).  Fix some minor typos and improper
	wordings while we are at it.

	texi: require Texinfo >= 4.9, related enhancements

	We start passing the '--build-dir' option to the texi2dvi and texi2pdf
	invocations done in our Texinfo-related rules.  The argument for this
	option will be specific for each info_TEXINFOS entry, to work around a
	texi2dvi bug that could otherwise cause racy failures in parallel make
	builds:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-06/msg00073.html>
	That bug seems already fixed in the development version of texi2dvi,
	though:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-06/msg00074.html>
	so the details of our '--build-dir' usage can be revisited once we can
	assume Texinfo 5.0 or later.

	Since the '--build-dir' options has been only supported since Texinfo
	4.9, we lose compatibility with all older Texinfo versions.

	But we also get some real improvements.

	First, the '--build-dir' option implies the '--tidy' option; this, like
	the '--clean' option that we were formerly using, prevents cluttering of
	the build directory with all the TeX and Texinfo auxiliary files and
	build by-products, but, differently from '--clean', keeps them around
	for later re-runs to use; this shortens the rebuild times considerably.

	Second, the use of '--build-dir' also allows us to specify different
	build directories for the PDF and DVI output, preventing the rules
	building them from stomping on each other's feet when run in parallel.
	This is demonstrated by the test cases 'txinfo-no-clutter.sh' and
	'txinfo33.sh', which before this change used to fail when run with
	MAKE="make -j4", but now succeed even in that case.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* lib/am/texibuilds.am: Do not try to avoid texi2dvi/texi2pdf option
	'-o'; it has been supported since Texinfo 4.1, and we now require
	Texinfo >= 4.9.  Remove an obsolete comment.  Modify calls to texi2dvi
	and texi2pdf to use the '--build-dir' option, so that TeX auxiliary
	files and build by-products for a 'foo.texi' input will be placed in
	a 'foo.t2d' directory (for texi2dvi) or in a 'foo.t2p' directory (for
	texi2pdf).
	* automake.in (scan_texinfo_file): Greatly simplify the implementation,
	since we don't need anymore to keep track of the TeX auxiliary files and
	build by-products to clean.  Drop the '@CLEAN_FILES' part of the return
	value.
	(handle_texinfo_helper): Adjust the 'scan_texinfo_file()' call to its
	new signature.  Append the "work directories" now created by texi2dvi
	and texi2pdf invocation to the list of files/directories removed upon
	"make mostlyclean".
	* lib/am/texinfos.am: Update the cleaning rules (and comments)
	accordingly.
	* t/txinfo-no-clutter.sh: Minimal adjustment to avoid spurious failures.
	* .gitignore: Update.

	docs: recursive make considered harmful

	In the documentation, we shouldn't confuse "packages using subdirectories"
	with "packages using recursive make invocations".  A package can have a
	careful organization in subdirectories, make no (or almost no) use of make
	recursion (examples of such packages are GNU bison, GNU cppi, and Automake
	itself).

	In fact, make recursion should be used as seldom as possible, because it
	makes the build system more brittle and dependency declarations less
	faithful.  See Peter Miller's article "Recursive Make Considered Harmful"
	for more a more in-depth discussion:

	    http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/

	* doc/automake.texi (Directories): Clarify how a build system based on
	make recursion does.  Observe that such a system, albeit being very
	widespread, has its own issues and drawbacks, and that one can have a

	rather than of "packages with subdirectories".

	subdirs: unify rules for "cleaning" and "normal" recursive targets

	Before this change, the recursive invocation of cleaning targets in
	the $(SUBDIRS) where done in inverse order, i.e., starting from the
	last $(SUBDIRS) entry and proceeding towards the first.  According
	to the code comments, this was done ...

	    ... in an attempt to alleviate a problem that can happen when
	    dependencies are enabled.  In this case, the .P file in one
	    directory can depend on some automatically generated header
	    in an earlier directory.  Since the dependencies are required
	    before any target is examined, make bombs.

	But this comment does not apply anymore to the current implementation
	of automatic dependency tracking: the '.Po' and '.Plo' files does not
	depend on any C header or source file, ever!

	So it seems that the distinction between "normal" and "cleaning"
	recursive targets is a stale leftover of an older implementation of
	the automatic dependency tracking.  In fact, the Automake History
	manual seems to confirm this suspect; the section "First Take on
	Dependency Tracking" reads:

	    Because each .P file was a dependency of Makefile, this meant
	    that dependency tracking was done eagerly by make.  For instance,
	    "make clean" would cause all the dependency files to be updated,
	    and then immediately removed.  This eagerness also caused problems
	    with some configurations; if a certain source file could not be
	    compiled on a given architecture for some reason, dependency
	    tracking would fail, aborting the entire build.

	and the following section "Dependencies As Side Effects" reads:

	    In this approach, the .P files were included using the -include
	    command, which let us create these files lazily.  This avoided
	    the "make clean" problem.

	So the distinction between "normal" and "cleaning" recursive targets
	has likely been obsolete since by then already.  We can thus remove
	such distinction, thus reducing some complications and duplication in
	our rules.  Doing so, the whole testsuite still passes (both with GCC
	and Sun C 5.9), even the test 'c-demo.sh', which, among the other
	things, exercise the setup described in the obsolete code comment
	referenced above.

	Finally, note that we still keep '$(RECURSIVE_CLEAN_TARGETS)' and
	'$(RECURSIVE_TARGETS)' as two distinct variables, to ensure a better
	backward-compatibility for any user-defined rules that happen to use
	those variables.

	* NEWS: Update.

	subdir-objects: improve "make mostlyclean" efficiency and flexibility

	Fixes automake bug#10697.

	Before this change, the generated Makefile issued one 'rm' invocation

	to be left behind when a source file was renamed or removed.

	* automake.in (handle_single_transform): When a subdir object is seen,
	update '%compile_clean_files' to clean all the compiled objects in its

	maint: deprecate 'configure.in' as autoconf input

	It has been years since that has been deprecated in the documentation,
	in favour of 'configure.ac':

	    Previous versions of Autoconf promoted the name configure.in, which
	    is somewhat ambiguous (the tool needed to process this file is not
	    described by its extension), and introduces a slight confusion with
	    config.h.in and so on (for which '.in' means "to be processed by
	    configure"). Using configure.ac is now preferred.

	It's now time to start giving runtime warning about the use of
	'configure.in', so that support for it can be removed in future
	versions of autoconf/automake.

	See also, in the Autoconf repository, commit 'v2.69-4-g560f16b' of
	2012-05-23, "general: deprecate 'configure.in' as autoconf input".

	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm: Issue a warning in the 'obsolete'

	perf: beginning of a performance testsuite

	Some tests in the Automake testsuite already aims only at verifying
	the performance, rather than the correctness, of some operations.
	Still, they are somewhat shoehorned and forced into the PASS/FAIL
	framework (say, with the 'ulimit' shell builtin used to verify some
	operation doesn't take up too much time or memory), but that is
	conceptually a stretch, and has already caused problems in practice
	(see automake bug#11512 for an example).

	So we start moving the "performance tests" out of the testsuite proper,
	and make them run only "on demand" (when the user exports the variable
	'AM_TESTSUITE_PERF' to "yes").  Ideally, we should provide those tests
	with a custom runner/driver that measures and displays the relevant
	performance information, but doing that correctly and with the right
	APIs is definitely more difficult, so we leave it for a later step
	(an hope we'll take such a step eventually).

	check: the parallel-tests driver is now the default

	The old serial testsuite driver is still supported, and can be activated
	by the 'serial-tests' option (introduced by commit 'v1.11-1989-gdeb7773'

	* gen-testsuite-part: Now that we use the 'parallel-tests' by default
	in our tests, we need to completely change the logic and semantics of
	generation of sibling tests for those tests that check the Automake

	    Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	ylwrap: preserve subdirectories in "#line" munging

	If Automake is used in non-recursive mode and one of the inputs is a
	yacc file, for example, "src/grammar.y", ylwrap will remove too many
	directories from the output file when it adjusts the paths in it.
	This results in #line directives referring to "grammar.y" instead of
	"src/grammar.y".

	This is a result of $input_rx simply taking all the directory
	components of the absolute input path and removing them.

	One solution is to store the path passed to ylwrap and replace
	$input_rx with it.  This is what we do.

	Suggestion and initial patch (without tests) by Nikolai Weibull:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2012-05/msg00013.html>
	Final patch by Stefano Lattarini.

	* lib/ylwrap ($input_sub_rx): New.
	When munging the #line directives, substitute '$input_rx' with it,
	instead of stripping it altogether.
	Adjust comments.
	* t/yacc-line.sh, t/lex-line: Adjust and extend.

	m4: prepend m4 builtins with "m4_"

	The comments in 'lib/autoconf/autoconf.m4' from Autoconf 2.69 read:

	  We discourage the use of the non prefixed macro names: M4sugar maps
	  all the builtins into 'm4_'.  Autoconf has been converted to these
	  names too.  But users may still depend upon these, so reestablish
	  them.

	Alas, in our init.m4 files, we were still using m4 builtins without
	prefixing them with "m4_".  Not nice for a package that is one of the
	major clients of Autoconf, and an integral part of the GNU Autotools!

	The new support for Objective C++ (to be added in Automake 1.12.1) can be

	years old when Automake 1.13 gets released), requiring it is acceptable.
	This will also simplify testing and maintenance of Automake, because we'll

	tests: use append mode to capture parallel make output

	This should fix the spurious failure reported in automake bug#11413.

	This is due to the fact that the redirected output of parallel make
	can racily loose lines.  For example, if GNU make (3.82) is run on
	a Makefile like this:

	  all = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
	  default: $(all)
	  $(all):
	        @sleep 0.$$(($RANDOM % 10)); echo $@

	and has its standard output redirected in overwrite-mode to a regular
	file, it looses a line of that output every 15 runs or so on a Fedora
	17 system with 64 ppc64 cores and Linux 3.3.1.  Redirection in append
	mode does not suffer of this problem.

	See also similar commit 'Release-1-10-280-g6426999' of 2009-03-10,
	"Use append mode to capture parallel test output", which tackled a

	maintcheck: avoid a couple of spurious failures

	* t/objcxx-deps.sh, t/objcxx-minidemo.sh: In C++ files, use

	had erroneously been applied to 'master' only rather than to
	'maint'.

	silent rules: support for them is always active now

	Before this change, support for silent rules was optional and activated
	only if the 'silent-rules' option was specified.

	The rationale behind that behaviour was that the silent-rules machinery
	originally only worked with make implementations supporting nested
	variables expansions, which isn't (or wasn't) a POSIX-specified features;
	so that packages wanting to be "extra-portable" couldn't use the
	silent-rules machinery at all.

	But after Paul Eggert's commit 'v1.11-598-g8493499' of 25-12-2011,
	"silent-rules: fallback for makes without nested vars" (motivated
	by automake bugs #9928 and #10237), Makefiles generated when the
	'silent-rules' option is enabled can work also with those make
	implementations that don't support nested variables expansion (albeit
	the configure-time selected verbosity cannot be overridden at make
	runtime in such case).

	In light of that, and since silent rules are disabled by default even
	when the 'silent-rules' option is given (unless the developer explicitly
	makes them enabled by default be calling "AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])" in
	configure.ac), we can now have the support for silent rules always
	enabled.

	The 'silent-rules' option will thus become a no-op, but will reaming a
	valid option for the time being, for better backward-compatibility.

	A collateral effect of this change is that the use of the 'silent-rules'
	option will not anymore automatically disable the warnings in the
	'portability-recursive' category.

	The present change is basically a backport of the Automake-NG commit
	'v1.11d-75-g61ca923' of 19-04-2012, "[ng] silent rules: support for
	them is always active now".  Stemmed by this thread on the Automake-NG
	list:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-ng/2012-04/msg00027.html>

	* automake.in: Enable silent-rules machinery unconditionally.  Reword
	some comments.  Do not switch off warnings in the category
	'portability-recursive' anymore if the 'silent-rules' option is
	given.
	* m4/init.m4: Call 'AC_REQUIRE' on 'AM_SILENT_RULES' unconditionally.
	* lib/Automake/Options.pm: Recognize 'silent-rules' as a dummy option.

	color-tests: coloring can be forced on non-ANSI terminals as well

	Before this change, colorization of testsuite output was suppressed
	whenever the terminal was recognized to be a "dumb" one, incapable
	of handling ANSI coloring (i.e., when the environment variable TERM
	had a value of "dumb").  This happened even when the AM_COLOR_TESTS
	variable was set to a value of "always".

	Such a behaviour was suboptimal and slightly confusing; in fact, if
	a user wants to force coloring of testsuite output that is being
	redirected to a regular file, he should be able to do so even if his
	terminal is not capable of handling ANSI colors -- in fact, such
	terminal wouldn't be involved with the testsuite output in any way,
	so why should it be allowed to influence it?

	Thus, we now enable coloring of test output whenever AM_COLOR_TESTS
	is set to "always", irrespective of the value of the TERM environment
	variable.

	* NEWS: Update.
	* lib/am/check.am [%?COLOR%] (am__tty_colors): Activate colorization
	of testsuite output whenever AM_COLOR_TESTS has the value of "always".
	* t/ax/tap-summary-aux.sh: Export the TERM environment variable to
	"dumb" when forcing colorization of the testsuite output; this should
	*not* prevent such colorization from taking place, and we want to

	invocation since we are at it.
	* t/color2.sh: Likewise, and check that exporting TERM=dumb actually
	prevents testsuite output colorization when AM_COLOR_TESTS is unset.
	* t/parallel-tests-reset-term.sh: Relax, to prevent it from failing
	spuriously due to the new semantic.

	fixup: avoid unconditional re-bootstrapping on "make dist"

	Since our 'bootstrap' script is distributed, the 'distdir' target depends
	on it.  But in our GNUmakefile, we also have a 'bootstrap' target declared
	.PHONY, which when called re-bootstrap the Automake distribution.  Thus,
	whenever we run "make dist", GNU make sees it must remake the 'bootstrap'
	target (as it is a dependency of the 'distdir' target), and thus ends up
	re-bootstrapping all the package (because of the .PHONY 'bootstrap' target
	in GNUmakefile).

	We fix this issue by renaming our bootstrap script to 'bootstrap.sh'.

	* bootstrap.sh: ... to this.

	* configure.ac (RELEASE_YEAR): New AC_SUBST'd variable, should hold
	the value of the current year.
	* Makefile.am (update-copyright): Be sure to also update the
	definition of 'RELEASE_YEAR' in configure.ac.

	substituted at make time) instead of hard-coding the release
	year.  This should ensure the copyright range in the version
	message and in the generated files (Makefile.in and aclocal.m4)
	are automatically kept up-to-date.

	bootstrap: add convenience make target

	Dependencies in the Automake build system are not completely specified
	(see for example the commit log of recent commit 'v1.12-10-gab14841',
	"build: avoid too greedy rebuilds in the testsuite").  In fact, some of
	them cannot even be; for example, Makefile is generated at configure
	time from Makefile.in, which should be regenerated by our bleeding-edge
	automake script, which is generated by out Makefile -- specifying the
	complete chain of dependencies here would bring to a circular dependency
	issue.

	For this reason, before testing or deploying a change, we are often
	forced to perform a full re-bootstrap of the Automake package, to ensure
	all our files are actually up-to-date.  Until now, this has to be done
	manually, thus causing wasted keystrokes and more possibilities of error.

	With this change, we introduce a new 'bootstrap' make target to
	automatize all the (easy) steps of this re-bootstrapping (plus some
	minor bells & whistles since we are at it).

	* GNUmakefile: Rewrite to allow an easy bootstrapping and clean rebuild
	of the whole package, in particular with the help of ...
	(bootstrap): ...  this new target.

	maint: don't use "union" merge driver for NEWS anymore

	The use of the "union" merge driver to avoid conflicts in NEWS has
	proven to be problematic, as it often silently produced mis-merges
	(instead of spurious conflicts, but a spurious conflict is better
	than a mis-merge).  Also, our new branching policy (see automake
	bug#11153 for a description) should greatly mitigate the problem of
	merge conflicts in NEWS.  For further discussion, see:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-04/msg00148.html>

2012-04-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	build: avoid too greedy rebuilds in the testsuite

	The autogenerated makefile fragment 't/testsuite-part.am' used to depend
	on the list of *all* the hand-written files.  This was technically correct,
	since that makefile fragment was (and still is) generated by the script
	'gen-testsuite-part', which scans all the hand-written files to detect
	implicit dependencies and to decide for which tests a further wrapper test
	should be generated.

	However, the presence of such a dependency implied that, whenever *any*
	test case was modified (no matter how slightly), the 't/testsuite-part.am'
	file was rebuilt, and since that is included by our 'Makefile.am', the
	'Makefile.in' file was rebuilt as well by automake.  In order to do so,
	automake scanned our 'configure.ac' file, which requires the latest
	Autoconf version (2.69 at the time of writing), and the casual user can
	easily lack that on his machine (and that should be allowed, as automake
	currently supports any autoconf version >= 2.62).

	The described situation could hinder in-field testing or debugging by
	users (even experienced ones) that are not automake developers; see for
	example automake bug#11347.

	So we drop the explicit dependency of 't/testsuite-part.am' on the
	hand-written test cases.  (As an aside, note that this has already
	been done in Automake-NG, albeit for other reasons; see the commit
	'v1.11b-129-g1690aca' of 2012-04-23, "[ng] build: define $(TESTS)
	through a wildcard").

	This is not a serious regression in the faithfulness of the Automake
	build systems, since it unfortunately already had several undeclared
	dependencies; e.g., 'Makefile.in' should depend on the automake script,
	and 'aclocal.m4' should depend on the aclocal script (but this isn't
	possible, as it would mean that distributed files depend on ones generated
	at make time).  Similarly, 'Makefile.in' should depend on some of the
	'lib/am/*.am' files, but does not.

	Currently, the workaround to get a faithful and correct rebuild is to run

	  ./bootstrap && ./config.status --recheck && make clean all

	and the present commit does not change that.

	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/t/testsuite-part.am): Don't depend on
	't/list-of-tests.mk' nor on '$(handwritten_TESTS)' anymore.
	($(generated_TESTS)): Likewise, and don't depend on 'Makefile.am'
	either.

	tests: fix a failure in Lex/C++ tests on Mac OS X

	The <cstdio> header from Xcode-4.3.2 on Mac OS X 10.7.3 declares a 'isatty'
	function with C++ linkage, that conflicts with our dummy definition of the
	same function, which in turn is required to work around the absence of the
	unistd.h header on MinGW (see commit 'v1.11-2138-gfeea090' of 11-04-2012).
	So we tweak the affected tests to work around this new problem as well.

	coverage: test the internal $(am__relativize) variable

	This new coverage might turn out be useful for the planned changes
	in Automake-NG.  Even if it eventually doesn't, we gen an improved
	testsuite exposure of some non-trivial internals, so it's always a
	win for us.

	* t/relativize.tap: New test.
	* t/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

2012-04-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: cater to systems installing libs in /lib64

	See automake bug#11302.

	On at least OpenSUSE 12.1, "make install" will install libraries in
	the '${prefix}/lib64'  directory by default.  This is due to the
	$CONFIG_SITE set by /etc/profile.d/site.sh, which sets a libdir
	that ends in '/lib64' rather than '/lib' if it finds that the compiler
	is generating 64-bit code.  This behaviour was causing some spurious
	failures in our testsuite.  Fix them.

	* t/posixsubst-libraries.sh: Assume the libraries are installed in
	'$(libdir)' rather than in '$(prefix)/lib'.
	* t/posixsubst-ltlibraries.sh: Likewise.
	* t/posixsubst-scripts.sh: Similarly, don't assume that '$(bindir)',
	'$(sbindir)' and '$(libexedir)' always defaults to respectively
	'$(prefix)/bin', '$(prefix)/sbin' and '$(prefix)/libexec'.
	* t/transform3.test: Likewise.

	    Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	tests: fix spurious failure on Mac OS X

	See automake bug#11306.

	* t/lex-libobj.sh: We used to pass LEXLIB='-L /lib' to the ./configure
	invocation, to prevent it from explicitly searching for a "lex library".
	But the linker on MacOS X 10.5 apparently chokes on that:

	  cc -g -O2  -o foo foo.o -L /lib yywrap.o
	  ld: file not found: /lib
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

	So, we now instead pass LEXLIB=' ', which being non-empty is enough
	to prevent the search of a "lex library".  And since we are at it,
	enhance comments on this non-obvious usage.

2012-04-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	vala: configure exit with status 77, not 1, if valac version is too old

	From a report by Bruno Haible in automake bug#1193.  This change should
	also automatically avoid spurious testsuite failures with older vala
	versions.

	* m4/vala.m4 (AM_PROG_VALAC): Exit with status 77, rather than 1, if
	the Vala compiler found older than the minimal required version (if
	any).  This is more consistent with what is done by other macros like
	AM_PROG_UPC or AC_PROG_CC.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* t/vala-headers.sh: Adjust, so that the test is only skipped of the
	vala compiler is too old or the required PKG_CHECK_MODULES third-party
	macro is not found by aclocal, and not if a generic error happens in
	the configure script.
	* t/vala-libs.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala2.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala3.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala5.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala-vpath.sh: Likewise (but don't check for the potential error

	* t/vala4.sh: Adjust, to avoid the new semantic causing this test to
	skip instead of failing.

	refactor: processing of input makefile rules

	This is a pure refactoring, with no intended functional or semantic
	changes.  It breaks up an overly-long function in three smaller
	sub-functions.  This change will very especially useful for the work
	on Automake-NG.

	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (define): Move quite a lot of code out, into ...
	(_rule_defn_with_exeext_awareness, _maybe_warn_about_duplicated_target,

2012-04-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	automake: refactor pre-processing of makefile fragments

	This change will provide the automake script with a new function that
	reads in a Makefile fragment *without* performing Automake ad-hoc parsing,
	but only the pre-processing step, i.e., removal of '##' comments and
	substitution of tokens like '%SUBDIRS%', '%?LIBTOOL%' or '?GENENRIC?'.

	This will very likely be useful for the work on Automake-NG.

	This is a pure refactoring, with no intended functional or semantic
	changes.

	* automake.in (preprocess_file): New function, extracted ...
	(make_paragraphs): ... from here.

2012-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	docs: remove obsolete references to Autoconf 2.13

	Autoconf 2.13 is definitely obsolete today, so giving hints or caveats
	about it in the Automake documentation is not only obsolescent, but
	also counter-productive, as it suggests that autoconf 2.13 is still
	relevant.

	* doc/automake.texi: Adjust.  Related rewordings.  Since we are at it,
	prefer using a more modern autoconf version number (2.68 instead of 2.57)
	in an example showing how to correctly use 'AC_PREREQ' in third-party
	.m4 files.

	maintainer-check: do not hang

	* syntax-checks.mk (ams): The definition of this variable was invoking

	other hang.  Fix this.

2012-04-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: 'recheck' must depend on 'all'

	Fixes automake bug#11252.

	When a developer experience one or more failures in the testsuite, a good
	workflow is for him to modify its program's sources to fix the bug thus
	revealed, run "make recheck" to verify that the change has indeed solved
	the testsuite failures previously experienced, and then run "make check"
	to verify that the change has not introduced any new failure or regression.

	Unfortunately, this apparently natural workflow couldn't have worked until
	now, since the Automake-provided 'recheck' target (which didn't depend on
	'all') wouldn't have causes the program to be recompiled, and the failed
	tests would have thus been run with the older, buggy version of the
	program, failing the same way as before.

	* lib/am/check.am (recheck): Depend on 'all'.
	* t/parallel-tests-recheck-depends-on-all.sh: New test.

	install: shell parameter expansions can be used in directory names

	Fixes automake bug#11232.

	GNU automake used to support shell parameter expansion and command
	substitutions in installation directories, but that was inadvertently
	broken by commit v1.11-759-g368f1c4 "install: don't create empty dirs
	when an empty 'foo_PRIMARY' is used" of 18-03-2012, where shell quoting
	of generated MKDIR_P command was changed from double to single quotes

	build: generate doc/*.1 files; include help2man

	This change is required to avoid making a distributed file depend
	on a generated (non-distributed) one.  The preceding change
	introduced one such dependency, with the distributed doc/*.1
	depending on the generated aclocal and automake files.  Here,
	we avoid the problem by generating the doc/*.1 files rather than
	distributing them.

	* doc/help2man: New file, version 1.37.1.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add doc/help2man.
	(man1_MANS): Rename from $(dist_man1_MANS).  Remove $(srcdir) prefix.
	(CLEANFILES): Add these files here, rather than to
	$(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES), since we are no longer distributing them.
	(update_mans): Use doc/help2man, not $(HELP2MAN).
	* configure.ac: Don't test for help2man, now that we bundle it.

2012-04-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid parallel build failures

	A parallel build would fail when two concurrent sub-make processes
	tried to build lib/Automake/Config.pm.  The loser would complain that
	  grep: lib/Automake/Config.pm-t: No such file or directory
	  chmod: cannot access `lib/Automake/Config.pm-t': No such file or\
	    directory
	  make[1]: *** [lib/Automake/Config.pm] Error 1
	* Makefile.am (update_mans): Don't build lib/Automake/Config.pm here.
	Instead, depend on it from the two rules that use it:
	($(srcdir)/doc/aclocal-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on it.
	($(srcdir)/doc/automake-$(APIVERSION).1): Likewise.

	[ Note that technically, the above is incorrect, since it makes those
	  distributed doc/*.1 files depend on generated aclocal and automake.
	  That problem is addressed by the following commit. ]

	However, that was not enough, since even then, a parallel build
	would still fail, now with this:

	  help2man: can't get `--help' info from automake-1.11a
	  Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr
	  make: *** [doc/automake-1.11a.1] Error 1

	a subsequent "make -j3" would create the missing file.
	That was because help2man would invoke t/wrap/aclocal.in and
	t/wrap/automake.in, each of which would require aclocal and
	automake, yet those two files weren't guaranteed to be created.
	Add explicit dependencies:
	($(srcdir)/doc/aclocal-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on aclocal.
	($(srcdir)/doc/automake-$(APIVERSION).1): Depend on automake.

	* HACKING (Working with git): Document the new policy for automake

	  - the maintenance branch will be 'maint', and we will cut the
	    maintenance releases directly from there;

	  - the development branch will be 'master', and we will cut the
	    new releases directly from there;

	  - 'maint' will be kept regularly merged into 'master'.

	vala tests: avoid spurious failure with older GObject

	* t/vala2.sh: In the 'PKG_CHECK_MODULES' call in 'configure.ac',

	order for the test to pass.
	* t/vala3.sh: Likewise.
	* t/vala5.sh: Likewise.  Also, skip the test instead of failing
	if the ./configure invocation fails: that is likely due to the

	vala tests: force the use of automatic dependency tracking

	* t/vala-mix2.sh: Invoke ./configure with the option

	at least on Solaris when the Sun C compiler is used.

	The commit v1.11-2058-g6f4b08d of 06-03-2012, "tests: explicitly

	is not flex and does not understand the "%option never-interactive"

	able to compile also on MinGW/MSYS.

	tests: rename 'tests/' => 't/', '*.test' => '*.sh'

	When we (soon) convert the Automake testsuite to a non-recursive
	make setup, we'll have to fix the entries of $(TESTS) to be
	prepended with the subdirectory they are in; this will increase
	the length of $(TESTS), and thus increase the possibility of
	exceeding the command-line length limits on some systems (most
	notably, MinGW/MSYS).  See automake bug#7868 for more information.

	Thus we rename the 'tests/' subdirectory to 't/', and each 'x.test'
	script in there to 'x.sh'; this way, the $(TESTS) entry 'foo.test'
	will become 't/foo.sh', which have the same number of characters.

	maint: remove most recursion in automake's own build system

	Recursive make-based build systems tend to be slower, more fragile
	and less faithful than "flat" ones.  See Peter Miller's article
	"Recursive Make Considered Harmful" for more a more in-depth
	discussion:

	    <http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/>

	While in the case of automake this isn't a big problem (given the
	small size of its build systems), it still creates occasional
	glitches and annoyances.

	With this change, the use of recursion in Automake's own build
	system is eliminated *but for the testsuite*.  Converting that
	is a little more tricky, and better left for a later change (or
	series of changes).

	See also commit v1.11-769-gfeeb7f6 of 28-03-2012.

	* contrib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am, m4/Makefile.am,
	doc/Makefile.am:  Removed, their content merged ...

	texinfo: warn about future use of '--tidy'

	Starting from the next major release of Automake (likely 1.13) we
	want to start passing the '--tidy' option to texi2dvi and texi2pdf
	invocations, so that auxiliary TeX-generated files can be kept
	around (thus speeding up rebuilding of DVI and PDF output) without
	cluttering the build directory too much.

	Since the '--tidy' option was introduced in Texinfo 4.9 (as
	documented in the Texinfo distribution's NEWS file), this also
	means that Makefiles generated by future Automake versions will
	require at least that version of Texinfo (at the time of writing
	four years and nine months old).

	The users should be warned about the planned behavioral change
	and the new version requirement it will entail.

	See also automake bug#11146.

	* NEWS (Planned Backward Incompatibilities): Add entry about use
	of the '--tidy' option and requirement of Texinfo 4.9.

	texinfo: don't clutter the builddir when using modern texi2dvi

	In modern versions of texi2dvi (at least since version 1.135, which
	comes with Texinfo 4.13) the '-o' option does not imply anymore the
	'--clean' option.  As a consequence, lots of TeX-generated auxiliary
	files are now left in the build directory by the 'pdf', 'ps' and
	'dvi' rules.

	This is especially annoying with non-recursive setups having the
	'.texi' files in a subdirectory, as in:

	  info_TEXINFOS = doc/foo.texi

	In this case, the stray auxiliary files are left in the top build
	directory (since TeX is run from there).  See for example:

	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2012-04/msg00002.html>

	See also automake bug#11146.

	* lib/am/texibuild.am: Call 'texi2dvi' and 'texi2pdf' with the
	'--clean' option.  Update comments accordingly.
	* tests/txinfo-noclutter.test: New test.

	acinstall: remove, it has never been really used

	Accordingly to the git history (see for example the 'README-alpha'
	in commit 'Release-1-1e-39-g9beb4ec' of 06-10-1996), the 'acinstall'
	script should have been used to install m4 files for aclocal.  The
	comments in this script report that "... A script is needed to do
	this because we want to do serial-number checking; newer versions
	of macro files should always be preferred".

	But the 'acinstall' script has never been really used: for example,
	the entry "actually use acinstall program" was removed (unfixed)
	from the TODO file in commit 'Release-1-1k-12-g1201405' of
	08-12-1996, and the only citation of 'acinstall' in the manual was
	removed in commit 'Release-1-1l-37-g128c3d7' of 19-03-1997, and
	never added back. In addition, the last non-trivial edit to the
	script (that is, besides updates to the copyright notice) dates
	back to 1996.

	More importantly, now that aclocal supports the ACLOCAL_PATH
	environment variable, installing m4 files directly in the
	system-wide acdir is discouraged, and better left only to
	distros' package managers (which already have their own way to
	do so, with which third-party build systems should not directly
	meddle).

	So we just remove the 'acinstall' script.

	depcomp: support tcc (Tiny C Compiler)

	This change fixes automake bug#11007.

	Since git commit 0c928da9 of 21-06-2010, "tcc: Draft suppoprt for
	-MD/-MF options" (sic, with typo in summary line), tcc has supported
	automatic dependency generation with a command-line interface
	similar to what old (pre-8.0) Intel compilers did.  This caused
	Automake-generated code for automatic dependency tracking to
	recognize tcc dependency style as "icc".  However, the format of
	the dependency files generated by tcc is apparently different enough
	from that of icc to cause spurious failures in the post-processing
	operated by our 'depcomp' script on such files.

	The failure was exposed with the development version of tcc 0.9.26
	(as installed with debian package "tcc 0.9.26~git20120104.83d") by
	test case 'depcomp-auto.tap' (available only in the master branch).

	* lib/depcomp (icc): Cater to tcc as well.  Update comments
	accordingly.
	* NEWS: Update.

	tests: workaround for automatic linker determination and conditionals

	See automake bug#11089.

	Automake is not very smart in automatically determining the command
	to be used to link a program whose source files' languages are
	conditionally defined.  For example, an input like:

	  if HAVE_CXX
	  foo_SOURCES = more.c++
	  else
	  foo_SOURCES = less.c
	  endif

	will cause the build rules for 'foo' to *unconditionally* use the
	C++ compiler for linking, even when the 'HAVE_CXX' conditional
	evaluates to false (which might mean that no C++ compiler is
	available).

	This behaviour is not really correct, but it's easy enough to work
	around, and it's only relevant for fringe use cases (at best).  So
	let's just test that the workaround really works.

	* tests/link_cond.test: New test.
	* tests/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.
	* THANKS: Update.

	maint: update TODO file

	We don't have to make creation of $(foodir) conditional when
	foo_PRIMARY is conditionally defined; that has been solved in
	a more sweeping way by commit v1.11-759-g368f1c4 of March 18,
	which solved bug#11030 and bug#10997.

	The "check" target already depends on the "all" target.

	Remove comment "investigate problems with conditionally defined
	libraries"; it is aimed at automake 1.5 (!) and too terse and old
	to be useful now.

	Remove the 12 years old suggestion that "distcheck should make sure
	that each file that uses _() is listed in POTFILES.in"; this is
	handled by gnulib-provided syntax check 'sc_po_check' already today.

	Don't tell to "Run automake before libtool"; automake does not
	automatically run libtool anymore today.

	Remove hint about the possibility to "rewrite automake in guile" or
	"add a GUI": we are not going to do so.

	The automatic de-ANSI-fication feature has already been remove, so
	no need to suggest its potential removal in the future.

	Remove reference to a prospective "cvs" option that could add some
	cvs-specific rules.  First of all, CVS is falling out of use today.
	Secondly, and most to the point, instead of guessing which VCS
	is going to be most popular and try to hack support for it into
	automake, we should leave it to developer-specific makefile
	fragments offered by projects like Gnulib to provide such rules
	(they are already doing so with succcess).

	About DOS support: it should actually be dropped, not extended.

	Add link about Karl Berry's proposal of preferring HTML over Info
	documentation installed in the local system:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/texinfo-devel/2012-03/msg00018.html>

	Remove items about "beautification" of output Makefile.in; they
	are pretty obvious, and mostly noise (after all, everybody prefers
	clean output where possible).  Leave it to any developer doing
	future refactorings to find out low-hanging and/or high-impact
	optimizations and beatifications of the generated Makefiles.

	Remove item about internationalization: we're not going to
	implement it.

	Remove an item explicitly marked as "not that it matters".

	The order of files in a distribution tarball does not really
	matter, nobody has ever complained about it, so do not worry
	about it.

	Remove the suggestions about allowing hierarchy of dirs to share
	one aclocal.m4 and about printing full file name of Makefile.am
	or configure.in when giving error, in order to help very large
	trees: nobody has ever complained about the current behaviours,
	so no real need to change them.

	install: don't create empty dirs when an empty 'foo_PRIMARY' is used

	Fixes automake bug#11030 and bug#10997.

	An empty declaration of "foo_PRIMARY" in a Makefile.am used to
	cause the generated install rules to create the directory $(foodir)
	anyway, even if nothing was to be installed there.

	While this could be seen as a convenient way to create a $(foodir)
	directory upon "make install" (respecting $(DESTDIR) settings and
	such), it also caused problems with conditionals; for example, an
	input of:

	  if FALSE
	  pgkdata_DATA = something
	  endif

	caused the generated install rules to unconditionally create the
	$(pkgdatadir) directory (see automake bug#10997).

	Also, a user wanting to create an empty directory upon installation
	can easily do so with a custom install hook, as in:

	  installdirs-local:
	          $(MKDIR_P) $(DESTDIR)$(foodir)
	  install-data-hook: installdirs-local

	On the other hand, the old behavior of "always create $(foodir),
	even if 'foo_PRIMARY' is empty" was harder and more tricky to
	override.

	Thus, from now on, an empty declaration of "foo_PRIMARY" will not
	cause the directory $(foodir) to be created upon "make install"
	anymore.

	Reported by Panther Martin in automake bug#10866, diagnosed by
	Panther Martin and Eric Blake.

	Older GNU m4 versions (e.g., 1.4.6) did error reporting at the end

	tests: avoid spurious failures in get-sysconf.test

	This change fixes the last bit of automake bug#10866.

	* tests/get-sysconf.test: When Homebrew spawns a build, even if
	from a project's VCS, it stages the files in a new temporary
	directory, instead of building directly from a VCS checkout.
	This behaviour was causing a spurious failure in this test, which
	expected to find either a ChangeLog file or a .git directory in
	the source directory (the former happening when the test was run
	from a distribution tarball, the latter when it was run from a
	git checkout).  The Homebrew issue shows that these expectations
	are not truly warranted, so relax the test to just give a warning,
	not a failure, in case they do not hold.  Since we are at it, fix
	an unrelated weakness in the displaying of the git log, which
	could have failed when the builddir was not a subdirectory of the
	srcdir.

	Merge branch 'msvc' into maint

	This merge remedies the confusing situation that some changes
	destined for both the master branch and the release branch (a.k.a.
	branch-1.11) currently needs to be made on the non-obvious msvc
	branch and not on the more natural maint branch.  This has caused
	a seemingly endless string of less than optimal commits.

	The reason for the confusion stems from the fact that the changes made
	on the msvc branch became too radical and was considered only suitable
	for the master branch, and was thus written in a form suitable for
	master and then merged there.  Later, the msvc branch was merged
	directly into branch-1.11, in order to rush the new features to the
	market and to keep the released scripts (lib/ar-lib, lib/compile and
	lib/depcomp) consistent with those on the master branch.  However,
	some changes had to be made to the features added by the msvc branch
	in order for them to fit the requirements of branch-1.11, notably that
	the warnings issued in the extra-portability class cannot be enabled
	by -Wall in the 1.11.x maintenance releases.

	In retrospect, it would have been better to not merge msvc directly
	into branch-1.11, but instead do it via the maint branch (followed up
	with a dummy merge from maint into master) the moment it was decided
	that the msvc changes should make it into branch-1.11.

	All in all, this merge is going to affect neither the master branch
	nor branch-1.11, since it is followed up with dummy merges masking all
	changes.  The merge is made to maintain the sanity of the poor
	developers, who wishes to once again have a working maint branch.

	Discussion about merging the msvc branch into branch-1.11:

	tests: do not clobber the $CC set by AM_PROG_CC_C_O

	If $CC is originally a losing compiler, AM_PROG_CC_C_O will

	and reintroduce the raw losing compiler causing the test
	to fail, as subdir-objects is in effect.

	maint: require perl 5.6 throughout

	That version of perl is quite old already, so it should be OK to
	require it.  More importantly, it is the older perl versions the
	developers can currently use for testing, thus it's safer and more
	honest to just require it throughout.  And anyway, we were already
	requiring it in Automake::Getopt, which implied that both automake
	and aclocal wouldn't have worked in practice with an older perl
	version.

	self checks: relax tests on cleanup

	Some find(1) implementations have problems operating recursively on
	directories having subdirectories with null permissions, even when
	the permissions of such subdirectory should be fixed by find before
	it descends into them; for example, with this setup:

	  % mkdir a a/b
	  % chmod 000 a/b

	a command like this:

	  % find a -type d ! -perm -700 -exec chmod u+rwx '{}' ';'

	fails with this diagnostic on MacOS X 10.7:

	  find: a/b: Permission denied

	and with this diagnostic on Solaris 10:

	  find: cannot read dir a/b: Permission denied

	The problem is that our self checks were simply demanding too much
	from our cleanup trap: our tests never use subdirectories with null
	permissions, so it doesn't matter if the cleanup trap fails to
	handle those.  Just relax the self checks to avoid such useless
	testsuite noise.

	* tests/self-check-cleanup.tap: Only try directories missing
	write permissions, not with null permission.  That should be
	enough for our usages.

	tests: looks for GNU compilers at configure time

	This way, if the generic C compiler determined configure time is
	recognized to be the GNU C compiler, we can reuse it instead of
	looking for a compiler named "gcc" (over and over again) in the
	test scripts requiring the GNU C compiler.  Ditto for the C++,
	Fortran, and Fortran 77 compilers.

	This change will improve coverage by allowing us to more easily
	use non-default GNU compilers throughout the testsuite.

	And as a bonus, this change also removes a weakness from our
	testsuite that could cause spurious failures when flags passed
	to the generic compilers were erroneously reused for the GNU
	compilers; see automake bug#10859.

	* configure.ac: Look for the GNU compilers explicitly.  Improve
	some configure output and diagnostic since we are at it.
	* tests/defs-static.in ($GNU_CC, $GNU_CXX, $GNU_FC, $GNU_F77):
	Initialize with the values determined at configure time (while
	allowing user overrides).
	* tests/Makefile.am (do_edit): Also substitute the configure-time
	values of GNU_CC, GNU_CXX, GNU_FC and GNU_F77.
	* tests/defs (gcc, g++, gfortran, g77): Use the values for the GNU
	compilers determined at configure time (i.e., $GNU_CC for the GNU
	C compiler, and so on).

	spy: "rm -f" and "rm -rf" without args are portable

	According to recent testing by Eric Blake, it seems that all
	non-museum rm(1) implementations don't complain if called without
	file operands, *if* the '-f' option is used.  This behaviour will
	likely be mandated by future versions of the POSIX standard as
	well.

	We'd like to start assuming this rm(1) behaviour in future Automake
	releases, in order to simplify some automake-provided cleanup rules.
	So, for the moment, we add a new "spy" test in our test suite, to
	try ensuring that all the rm(1) implementation we encounter "in the
	wild" truly behaves as expected in this regard.

	For more references, see this discussion on the bug-autoconf list:
	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2012-02/msg00002.html>
	which sprang from coreutils bug#10819:
	 <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10819>
	and brought to the POSIX issue#542:
	 <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>
	which has been accepted and will ensure that future version of the
	POSIX standards will mandate that 'rm' shouldn't complain if called
	without file operands, when the '-f' option is in use.

	* tests/spy-rm.test: New test.
	* tests/list-of-tests.mk: Add it.

	least since autoconf 2.50).

	Most of the test cases changed by this commit have been

	automake: new option 'serial-tests'

	Currently, automake offers a 'parallel-tests' option to enable the
	use of the parallel testsuite harness in the generated Makefiles,
	but no option to explicitly state the intention of using the older
	serial testsuite driver (which is currently the default).

	This makes the parallel test harness seems like a second-class
	citizen (while actually it should be the other way around); more
	importantly, it will prevent us from making the parallel harness
	be the default one in future automake versions, since the users
	of the serial harness would then have no way to instruct automake
	to continue using it.

	We solve all of this by introducing a new 'serial-tests' option.

	parallel-tests: fix another BSD parallel make issue

	When BSD make is run in parallel mode, it apparently strips any

	tests: relax a test to cater to NetBSD make

	* tests/parallel-tests-empty-testlogs.test: When $(TESTS) is empty,
	NetBSD 5.1 make ends up defining $(TESTS_LOGS) to ".log" rather than
	to the empty string (as would be expected).  This behaviour was
	causing a check in this test case to fail.  But that check was in
	fact overly strict, since our recipes are smart enough to work
	around the botched-up substitution.  Also, the failure wasn't a
	regression from Automake 1.11, since that version too would have
	triggered the same error with NetBSD 5.1 make.  So we just relax
	the test a little to avoid extra noise in the testsuite.

	tests: TAP-based tests should error if no plan was specified

	After this change, it will still be OK for TAP-based tests not to
	report any explicit TAP plan -- but they should state *explicitly*
	that they want to do so, by calling the 'plan_' function with a
	proper argument (currently, either "later" or "unknonwn").

	Motivated by a recent issue introduced by yesterday's commit
	'v1.11-1959-g0699a84' (pointed out by Peter Rosin, and fixed
	by follow-up commit 'v1.11-1961-gea44190').

	* tests/tap-functions.sh (plan_): Get rid of '$have_tap_plan_',
	and refactor use and initialization of '$planned_' in a way that
	will allow client script to get more information on which kind
	of plan (if any) has been declared by the former 'plan_' invocation.
	(skip_all_): Adjust.
	* tests/defs (exit trap): Only print the "lazy" TAP plan if 'plan_'
	has requested that *explicitly*.
	* syntax-check.mk (sc_tests_tap_plan): Remove: it's obsolete now,
	since a TAP-based test that doesn't call 'plan_' explicitly won't
	print any TAP plan, and the TAP driver will catch that and report
	an error.
	(syntax_check_rules): Adjust.

	depcomp tests: fix up today's botched commit

	Today's commit 'v1.11-1959-g0699a84' has caused the generated

	tests: avoid ksh bug for wildcards in EXTRA_DIST

	Some shells, like NetBSD 5.1 /bin/ksh, have a bug that causes
	wildcards resulting from an unquoted parameter expansion not to
	be expanded as expected in some cases:

	    $ touch a b c d
	    $ /bin/sh -c 'var="[ab]" && echo $var' # As expected.
	    a b
	    $ /bin/ksh -c 'var="[ab]" && echo $var' # Oops.
	    [ab]
	    $ /bin/ksh -c 'var="?" && echo $var' # But this as expected.
	    a b c d

	This was causing a failure in our testsuite.  Work around that.

	See also:

	using a "bare" wildcard expression in EXTRA_DIST, without involving
	the $(wildcard) builtin, to ensure coverage of similar usages "in
	the wild".

	tests: truly use Lex and Yacc selected by configure

	When 'yacc-work' was merged into 'yl-work-for-master' in commit
	v1.11-1910-ge6c40d4 (12-02-2012), the values for $YACC and $LEX
	stopped being substituted directly by config.status, and started
	being substituted by a Makefile rule using the contents of the
	$(YACC) and $(LEX) makefile variables.

	Unfortunately, our configure.ac was calling AM_SUBST_NOTMAKE on
	'YACC' and 'LEX' (see commit v1.11-284-g34ca92b of 29-01-2011,
	"tests: don't define YACC and LEX in the Makefiles", for a
	rationale), so that the $(YACC) and $(LEX) in the Makefile simply
	hold the default make-provided values (that is, "yacc" and "lex"
	respectively), independently of what yacc and lex programs were
	defined at configure time.

	Apart from reducing coverage and creating confusion, this behaviour
	also caused spurious failures on systems lacking a yacc and/or lex
	programs.

	Problem reported by Peter Rosin.  References:
	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2012-02/msg00131.html>

	tests: increase coverage for depcomp tests

	On platforms requiring that no undefined symbols exist in order
	to build shared libraries (e.g. Windows DLLs), you have to
	explicitly declare that the libtool library you are building
	does not actually have any undefined symbols, for libtool to
	even try to build it as a shared library.  Without that
	explicit declaration, libtool falls back to a static library
	only, regardless of any --enable-shared flags etc.

	tests/depcomp.sh (Makefile.am): Add -no-undefined if a libtool
	library (.la) is built.
	(src/Makefile.am): Likewise.

	tests: fix spurious failures due to missing 'yywrap()' function

	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a 'yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with '-ll' and '-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.

	This behaviour is intended; the Autoconf manual reads:

	  You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	  both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source it
	  produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability, however,
	  you must either provide a function 'yywrap' or, if you don't use
	  it (e.g., your scanner has no '#include'-like feature), simply
	  include a '%noyywrap' statement in the scanner's source.

	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of
	the Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing 'yywrap' (this happens for example on Fedora-based
	systems).   The proper workaround is to simply provide a fall-back
	implementation of 'yywrap' in our lexers.

	See also similar commits 'v1.11-546-gca0ba5d' (24-10-2011),
	'v1.11-1085-gb5c3968' (24-10-2011) and 'v1.11-871-geb147a1'

	depcomp tests: avoid redundant runs for libtool tests

	When running libtool-oriented tests, our 'depcomp.sh' script used
	to run the same checks thrice: once after having run configure
	with the '--disable-shared' option, once after having run it with
	the '--enable-shared' option, and once by allowing configure to
	automatically select which kind of library (or libraries) to build.

	This was done to offer extra coverage for the less-common depmodes
	(like "aix" of "hp2") where the name of the compiler-generated
	depfiles can depend on whether libtool is in use *and* on which
	kind of libraries libtool is building (static, shared, or both).
	About this, see commit 'Release-1-10-24-ge89ec38' of 28-03-2007,
	"* lib/depcomp (aix): Rewrite depmode in the spirit of the tru64
	one".

	But that extra coverage came at the price of *considerably* slowing
	down the depcomp libtool-oriented tests, since for each of them the
	tested source tree was configured and built *twelve* times (rather
	than "just" four as it is for the non-libtool case).

	So, to strike a balance between coverage and speed, we now run the
	libtool-oriented tests with the three different configuration modes
	*only* when it is possible that the depmode that will get selected
	is one of those which can actually benefit from the extra coverage.

	* tests/depcomp.sh: Adjust to only run the threefold libtool tests
	when that can truly be potentially useful.  Add related explanatory
	comments.

	tests: avoid wrong skips in dist-formats.tap

	* tests/dist-formats.tap: The test checking whether the 'compress'
	program is actually capable of compressing files relied on the
	assumption that 'compress' exits with status zero if no problem
	occurs; alas, this reasonable assumption doesn't hold in practice,
	since 'compress' does (and is documented to) exit with status 2 if
	the output is larger than the input after (attempted) compression!
	Fix this by using and input that 'compress' can actually reduce in
	size when compressing.
	Do some related reformatting of surrounding code since we are at it.

	tests: better way to compare lists in Makefile rules

	With this commit, we introduce a new helper shell script for use
	in the testsuite, which is meant to allow the test cases to easily
	check whether two whitespace-separated lists are equal; this ability
	is particularly useful to check for equality of the contents of make
	variables that are expected to contain multiple whitespace-separated
	words, and are defined through line continuations (or are rewritten
	by automake in this way), or that contain expansion of potentially
	empty variables.

	Before this change, a test checking that an usage like this one:

	  VAR = valA
	  if COND1
	    VAR += val1 # com1
	  endif COND1
	  VAR += valC

	worked as expected, couldn't use rules like:

	  ## Doesn't work because $(VAR) expands to multiple words
	  verify:
	      test $(VAR) = "valA val1 valC"

	nor like:

	  ## Doesn't work because the final expansion of $(VAR) contains
	  ## repeated contiguous whitespace characters (it actually
	  ## equals "valA val1  valC", not "valA val1 valC"), and this
	  ## is an internal detail which might change and which we don't
	  ## want to explicitly rely on.
	  verify:
	      test "$(VAR)" = "valA val1 valC"

	Instead, we had to rely on cumbersome workaround such as:

	  ## This works, but is ugly.
	  verify:
	      test "`echo $(VAR)`" = "valA val1 valC"

	or:

	  ## This works, but is even uglier.
	  verify:
	      echo BEG: $(VAR) :END | grep "BEG: valA val1 valC :END"

	Now, with the help of the new 'is' script, we can perform such a
	check in a clearer and more straightforward way, as in:

	  ## Works, and reads clearly.
	  verify:
	      is $(VAR) == valA val1 valC

	* tests/is: New helper shell script, telling whether two whitespace
	separated lists are equal.

	tests: improve and rework tests on dependency tracking

	Fixes automake bug#10434.  Suggestion by Peter Rosin.

	The 'depcomp.tap' test case worked by trying to unconditionally
	force the compiler in use by the testsuite to use, one by one, *all*
	the dependency modes known by the 'depcomp' script, and, for each
	such forced mode that was compatible enough with said compiler not
	to cause breakage in the basic compilation rules, checking that it
	was *also* good enough not to break remake rules in VPATH builds.

	This seemed a good approach when this test was first introduced, as
	it apparently increased coverage for the less used and less tested
	dependency-tracking modes.  But in the log run it turned out the
	approach was actually in part too brittle, causing some annoying
	spurious failures (as with the Tru64 depmode forced on GCC, see
	automake bug#10434), and partly too forgiving, since, for some of
	the more corner-case dependency modes, the 'depcomp' script simply
	reverts to silently disabling dependency tracking when an error is
	encountered (this happened e.g., with the Tru64 depmode forced on
	the Sun C compiler 5.9), so that a passing test means nothing, and
	only gives a false sense of security.

	As Peter Rosin put it, "it's just dead wrong to assume that feeding
	-M or -xM to the compiler (or whatever other random stuff 'depcomp'
	might do) and not get an error is the same as dependencies magically
	appearing".

	So we get rid of this wrong approach, and in the process proceed to
	a complete overhaul of many of the tests on automatic dependency
	tracking, extending the offered coverage and rationalizing their
	organization.

	* tests/depcomp.sh: New helper script, used by several new
	autogenerated tests.
	* tests/gen-testsuite-part: Generate several tests based on the
	new 'depcomp.sh' script.  Emit makefile code that declares their
	dependency on that script, and that extends EXTRA_DIST in order

	dryrun: fix regression with '$(am__make_dryrun)'

	In commit v1.11-683-gda0964e of 05-02-2012, we introduced a new
	variable '$(am__make_dryrun)' that could be used in recipes to
	determine whether make is running in dry mode (e.g., as with
	"make -n").  Unfortunately, the idiom we used fails to take into
	account the case in which $(MAKEFLAGS) contains one or more variable
	definitions whose value is a whitespace-separated list; for example,
	if we invoke make as:

	  make check TESTS="n1.test n2.test"

	then the better make implementations out there (at least modern
	GNU make and BSD make) will export MAKEFLAGS to the following
	value:

	  TESTS=n1.test\ n2.test

	So a shell loop like the one we used in $(am__make_dryrun):

	  for flag in $$MAKEFLAGS; do ...

	won't behave as expected: the shell word-splitting rules will break
	up the entry for TESTS into the two distinct entries "TESTS=n1.test\"
	and "n2.test", and this second entry will goad our $(am__make_dryrun)
	code into thinking that make is performing a dry run!

	So now we simply loop over the expanded value of $(MAKEFLAGS).
	This solves the regression, but alas, is more brittle in case the
	users passes on the command line a macro value containing unbalanced
	" or ' quotes, or shell metacharacters like, say, '`' or '('.  This
	should almost never happen though, so we don't worry about it now;
	we will revisit the issue only when and if we receive bug reports in
	this area.

	* tests/make-dryrun.test: New test.

	tests: work around bug#7884 in many yacc/lex tests

	Due to automake bug#7884, many test cases on Yacc/Lex support are
	failing when run with FreeBSD make.  Since these failures are all
	due to the same bug, and that bug is well understood and already
	explicitly exposed in the dedicated 'yacc-dist-nobuild.test' test,
	the reported failures are mostly noise, that not only is annoying,
	but which might end up covering different real bugs or regressions.

	Thus we minimize such spurious failures, by ensuring the commands
	triggering them (most of them being "make distcheck" invocations)
	will be skipped when $MAKE suffers of the bug/limitation that
	triggers automake bug#7884.

	refactor: new variable telling whether make is running in "dry mode"

	We define a new variable '$(am__make_dryrun)', that can be used
	in recipes to determine whether make is running in "dry mode" (as
	with "make -n") or not.  This is useful in rules that invoke make
	recursively, and are thus executed also with "make -n" -- either
	because they are declared as dependencies to '.MAKE' (NetBSD make)
	or because their recipes contain the "$(MAKE)" string (GNU and
	Solaris make).

	tap/perl: handle missing or non-executable scripts better

	This change improves how our Perl-based TAP driver handles
	non-runnable test scripts (meaning they might be not executable,
	or not readable, or even not exist).  In particular, it makes the
	driver deterministically display a clear "ERROR" result instead
	of possibly dying with diagnostic from 'TAP::Parser' internals,
	and prevents it from displaying spurious "missing TAP plan" errors.

	Moreover, with this change, some testsuite failures present only
	with newer perl versions (e.g., 5.14) are fixed.  See automake
	bug#10418.

	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: When testing the perl implementation of
	the TAP driver, and when the perl interpreter offers a good-enough
	'IPC::Open3::open3' function, expect it not to display spurious
	"missing TAP plan" diagnostic if the error is actually due to a
	non-runnable test script.
	* lib/tap-driver.pl (start): Removed, broken up into ...
	(setup_io): ... this ...
	(setup_parser): ... and this, which now tries to catch and report
	errors in launching the test scripts.

	tests: avoid spurious failure of 'transform2.test' on Cygwin

	On newer Cygwin versions (at least 1.7.x), the 'transform2.test'
	test has been failing spuriously; the gist is the following:
	some *purposefully* rigged install rules there try something
	like:

	  install bla.exe .../inst/bin/foo.exe
	  install script.sh .../inst/bin/foo

	and the second install command fails (trying to overwrite the
	'.../inst/bin/foo.exe' file, likely due to overly aggressive
	appending of '.exe' suffix when copying/renaming Windows
	executables).  Since this is a Cygwin issue rather than an
	Automake one (and since the use case we are testing is a really
	corner-case anyway, making it unworthy to attempt to work
	around it in automake proper), we simply hack the test case
	to avoid the failure.

	tests: work around MinGW/MSYS issue in fd redirections

	Some checks on $(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT) were failing on MSYS, likely
	because system calls like "write(9, ...)" simply doesn't work for
	MinGW-compiled programs.  Similar usages work for the shell scripts
	though, since /bin/sh is an MSYS program and thus is a lot more
	POSIX-ish than most MinGW-compiled programs.

	The best fix for this issue is to separate the checks using shell
	scripts as dummy test cases from the checks using compiled programs
	for the same purpose, and skip these latter checks on MinGW.

	This change fixes automake bug#10466.  Report by Peter Rosin.

	So we now reveal this breakage in a new test case, and enhance

	by moving it from the category 'portability' to the category
	'unsupported'.

	readme: how to run the testsuite with cross-compilers

	* tests/README: Suggest a better way to run the automake testsuite
	with cross-compilers -- that is, configuring the Automake source
	tree with proper `--build' and `--host' configure option.  And
	yes, specifying both these options (not only `--host') is indeed
	required to avoid spurious failures in corner cases.
	When you call configure with the `--host' option but without the
	`--build' option, configure tries to auto-detect whether you are
	cross-compiling or not, by trying to run a generated executable.
	That test might spuriously "succeed" in some corner cases (e.g.,
	Cygwin is able to run non-Cygwin apps).  In fact, generally, it
	can be the case that a cross-compilation is not detected as a
	cross anymore just because someone has installed an emulator; as
	an example, think of what can happen on a GNU/Linux system that
	is configured (through the use of the binfmt_misc kernel module)
	to execute PE executables (compiled for MS-DOS or Windows) through
	Wine *automatically*.  In conclusion, configure needs to be used
	as recommended in the documentation (i.e., by specifying *both*
	`--host' and `--build' instead of just one of them) to not have
	the build fall into any of a number of weird traps.

	test defs: allow compilers to be auto-selected on user's request

	In the recent changes, by pre-setting the required compilers for
	the `configure' scripts launched by the test scripts, we have
	slightly reduced the coverage of autoconf/automake code aimed at
	automatically detecting said compilers.  This commit restore such
	coverage, by allowing the user to instruct the testsuite *not* to
	preset the testsuite compiler(s).

	* tests/defs (cc): If $CC is set to the special value "autodetect"
	or "autodetected", don't export the configure-detected CC, CFLAGS
	and CPPFLAGS variables; rather, unset them.

	no one of those compilers is available (after all, they're only
	needed by the testsuite, not to build automake), but currently
	autoconf doesn't offer an easy way to obtain this behaviour.
	We prefer non-GNU compilers to the GNU ones, to ensure better

	"multilib: deprecate, will be moved to contrib".

	multilib: deprecate, will be moved to contrib

	As of 2012-01-17, according to Google codesarch, almost no active
	package is using the 'multilib' feature offered by automake.

	The only major exception seems to be GCC...  But on a closer look,
	it become clear that GCC basically carries its own version of
	multilib support.  In fact, Automake syncs its 'config-ml.in' and
	'symlink-tree' scripts from GCC; and the GCC repository contains a
	version of the 'multi.m4' file that is *more* updated than the one
	in the automake repository (the former having being modified the
	last time in 2008, the latter only in 2006).

	The 'multilib' feature was anyway hardly documented at all, only
	being briefly cited in the manual as an "obscure feature", "still
	experimental", that was only for users "familiar with multilibs"
	and which "can debug problems they might encounter".  We expect
	such users to be motivated and knowledgeable enough to make the
	minor adjustments required to start using the contrib version of
	multilib, if they really need to.

	* NEWS (Future backward incompatibility): Update.
	* doc/automake.texi: Deprecate multilib support.  State that it
	will be removed from automake core in the next major release.
	* m4/multi.m4 (AM_ENABLE_MULTILIB): Deprecate.  If called, now
	gives a proper warning in the 'obsolete' category (while still
	retaining its former behaviour for the rest).
	* tests/multilib.test: Update.
	* contrib/multilib/multi.m4: New, verbatim copy of the earlier
	version of multi.m4, without the new deprecation warning.
	* Makefile.am (fetch): Don't sync the 'config-ml.in' file nor
	the 'symlink-tree' script from GCC SVN repository anymore.

	(WGET_GCC): Remove, it's not needed anymore.

	This change fixes automake bug#10555.

	Note that the bug was a minor one, since it didn't affect the

	printed by automake in some error messages (e.g., "The usual way

	  cmdline parsing: move into a dedicated perl module

2012-01-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	cmdline parsing: move into a dedicated perl module

	With this change, we delegate most of the automake and aclocal code
	for command-line options parsing to a new module "Automake::Getopt".
	This allows better code sharing between automake and aclocal, and
	also with Autoconf, which will sync the new module from us.  See
	also autoconf commit 'v2.68-120-gf4be358' (2012-01-17, "getopt: new
	Autom4te::Getopt module"), and this mailing list discussion:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2012-01/msg00033.html>

	This change might interact with the behaviour described in automake
	bug#7434; for example, starting from now, "automake -Wfoo --version"
	will cause automake to emit diagnostic like "unknown warning
	category 'foo'" before actually printing the version number and
	exiting.  This is not a big deal in practice, and the code sharing
	and simplifications introduced by this patch is certainly worth it.
	Still, we should revisited the issue in the future.

	* lib/Automake/Getopt.pm: New module, basically a slightly-edited
	copy of the 'lib/Autom4te/Getopt.pm' file from the autoconf devel
	repository (commit v2.68-120-gf4be358).  It defines and exports ...
	(parse_options): ... this new function.

	one of them ('parallel-tests-dryrun.test') in the maint branch, the
	other one ('parallel-tests-dry-run.test') in the master branch.

	Needless to say, their too-much-similar names can be a great source
	of confusion now.  Moreover, the two tests have been written during
	distinct refactorings, and are meant to exercise different code
	paths and/or usage scenarios, so that no one of them subsumes the
	other, and they should be both kept.

	Thus we simply rename both of them to avoid future confusion.

	tap: some makes in parallel mode unconditionally serialize output

	Some make implementations (among them, FreeBSD make, NetBSD make,
	and Solaris Distributed Make), when run in parallel mode, serialize
	the output from their targets' recipes unconditionally.  This has
	the nasty side effect that the user won't see the partial results
	of a TAP test until the test has terminated.  This is not something
	our TAP driver script can work around unfortunately; in fact, the
	driver is sending out its output progressively and "in sync" with
	test execution -- it is make that is stowing such output away
	instead of presenting it to the user as soon as it gets it.

	So we content ourself with working around the issue in our
	testsuite, to at least avoid failures we could do nothing to
	prevent.

	is a non-GNU make running in parallel mode.  And if Sun dmake is

	in the environment, but also if the make used in the testsuite is

	vala: avoid potential useless remakes (minor bugfix)

	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Ensure the timestamp file
	from which the C files generated from Vala sources depend on gets
	created with a modification time that is truly older than those of
	said generated C files.  This prevents make from attempting useless
	rebuilds (which were bound to happen deterministically on systems
	with sub-second timestamp resolutions).  It is worth noting that,
	luckily, those useless rebuild ended up being a no-op, since the
	Vala compiler is careful not to update the timestamp of an output
	file if its content has not changed from the previous version.
	Still, the useless rebuilds messed up "make -q" and "make -n"
	invocations, and were technically incorrect (despite being, as
	noted, inoffensive in practice).

	Problem revealed by failure of tests vala-mix.test and vala5.test
	on a fast Solaris 10 system whose filesystem had a sub-second
	timestamp resolution.

	maintcheck: consistency of list of test scripts

	This is basically a backport of commit 'v1.11-358-g7b6ab07'
	and its follow-ups.  The possibility of easily checking that
	the list of test scripts listed in a Makefile equals that of
	the tests on the filesystem has proved itself so useful that
	it's worth taking the annoyance of backporting it to maint.

	* CheckListOfTests.am: New file, backported from master (commit
	'v1.11-1736-g083a75b') with minor adjustments.
	(maintainer-check-list-of-tests): New target, check for consistency
	between the list of tests defined in the including Makefile and the

	maintcheck: completeness check on list of tests simplified

	* CheckListOfTests.am: Simplify the recipe, accordingly to the
	assumption that all the entries in $(TEST_EXTENSIONS) and in
	$(TESTS) have an associated real test script.  This was not the
	case when we used to have some entries in $(TESTS) that were not
	real files, but rather "parameters" (sort of) for the corresponding
	$(LOG_COMPILER).  However, that usage had proven to be confusing
	and brittle, and thus removed (see commit 'v1.11-1308-g375f23d' of

	* Makefile.am (git-diff): Remove.  First, we don't distribute diffs
	between an automake version and the next one anyway, so this target
	is pointless.   Moreover, its recipe has been broken for quite a
	long time now, always generating an empty diff due to the spurious
	'$(PACKAGE)' argument that was passed to the "git diff" invocation.
	(path-check): Remove.  The 'pathchk' program running in this check
	complains about any file with name longer than 14 characters, which
	is a ridiculously low limit for today standards.  Also, we already
	had several test scripts (no less than 195!) that were exceeding
	that limit, and nobody ever complained (not even on MinGW/MSYS nor
	Cygwin).

	dist: avoid $(distdir) removal failure on MSYS/MinGW

	This change fixes automake bug#10470.

	On MSYS (1.0.17) it is not possible to remove a directory that is
	in use, and this, together with timing issues, could cause spurious
	failures in the cleanup code of the "distcheck" recipe.  In fact,
	it should be noted that assuming a directory can be removed while
	it the CWD of a running process is a POSIX violation:

	  "If the directory is the root directory or the current working
	   directory of any process, it is unspecified whether the function
	   succeeds, or whether it shall fail and set errno to [EBUSY]."

	* lib/am/distdir.am (am__remove_distdir): If rm fails, sleep some
	seconds and retry, to give potential "pending" processes some time
	to exit and "release" the directory.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove 'distcheck-pr10470.test'.

	dist: distdir not unconditionally removed anymore for xz and lzip

	This change fixes automake bug#10444 a.k.a. bug#10448.

	The 'dist-xz' and 'dist-lzip' recipes were erroneously using
	'$(am__remove_distdir)' instead of '$(am__post_remove_distdir)'
	to cleanup the '$(distdir)'; so a "make dist" issued in a package
	using (say) gzip and xz compression would have failed to properly
	created the gzip tarball, since the distdir was unconditionally
	removed by "make dist-xz" upon its completion, instead of being
	left populated for the following "make dist-gzip".

	The problem with 'dist-xz' was introduced in the merge commit
	`v1.11-1142-g47587d1', and the problem with 'dist-lzip' was
	introduced in the merge commit `v1.11-1673-gc1b14e9'

	This change follows up on recent changes to the GNU coding standards.

	tests: safer declarations of test dependencies

	To declare prerequisites common to all the tests, we now prefer to
	use the special `check_DATA' and `check_SCRIPTS' variables rather
	than "lazy" dependency declaration like "$(TEST_LOGS): DEPS ...";
	this because the latter, allowing run-time overriding of the
	TEST_LOGS variable, turned out to be subtly incomplete in some
	situations involving non-trivial inter-test dependencies.  For
	example, if the user issued a:

	    make check TESTS=libtool.test

	before the `defs-static' file was created (either explicitly or
	implicitly), a spurious errors followed, along these lines:

	 1. $(TEST_LOGS) got dynamically defined to `libtool.log';

	 2. make saw that, in the Makefile, `libtool.log' was explicitly
	    declared depending on `libtool-macros.log' and `defs-static';

	 3. somehow, make considered the dependency on `libtool-macros.log'
	   *before* considering the one on `defs-static' (which BTW is
	   perfectly legitimate on make's part);

	 4. to satisfy such a dependency, make set out to execute the
	    test `libtool-macros.test' in order to create the file
	    `libtool-macros.log';

	 5. since `libtool-macros.log' was *not* in $(TEST_LOGS), it
	    didn't appear to depend on the `defs-static' file, so make
	    didn't consider necessary to build `defs-static' before
	    running the `libtool-macros.test' script;

	 6. but that script sources `./defs-static' in order to work;
	    thus the test `libtool-macros.test' failed spuriously.

	* tests/Makefile.am ($(TEST_LOGS)): Remove explicit declaration
	of dependency on the required files/scripts; instead use ...
	(check_SCRIPTS, check_DATA): ... these new variables.

2012-01-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: skip tests on perl TAP driver if TAP::Parser is not available

	We had so far taken for granted that all the perl installations
	modern enough to correctly run automake also came with a built-in
	TAP::Parser module; unfortunately, testing on MinGW/MSYS has
	shown that this is not always true, and that a lot of spurious
	testsuite failures would take place in such a situation (see
	automake bug#10440).

	Luckily, the perl implementation of the Automake TAP driver is
	only meant to be used for prototyping and consistency checks, the
	"real" Automake TAP driver being the portable one implemented in
	awk.  So we can simply skip the affected tests on systems lacking
	TAP::Parser.

	* tests/defs (fetch_tap_driver): Skip the whole test case if
	the desired tap driver implementation is the perl one but the
	TAP::Parser module is unavailable.
	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: Adjust order of calls to `plan_' and
	`fetch_tap_driver', to ensure the test is not skipped after the
	TAP plan has been outputted (which would lead to a spurious
	error).
	* tests/tap-bad-signal.tap: Tweak to avoid the need to source the
	`tap-setup.sh' script, as that might cause a test skip too late,
	i.e., after a TAP plan has been already printed.
	* tests/tap-test-number-0.test: Do not force the test to skip

	dist: do not wrap calls to 'tar' with the 'missing' script

	The `missing' script is meant to allow non-developers to build a
	package in the face of slightly-skewed timestamps (as might happen
	e.g. when the package is obtained from a VCS checkout rather than
	from a distribution tarball).  It is *not* the business of the
	`missing' script to try to provide wrappers for all the maintainer
	tools (in this case, to tool being a decent tar program).  Such
	wrapping of `tar' was not only inappropriate, but it was also
	preventing the legitimate overriding (at make runtime) of the
	`tar' program used in the creation of the distribution tarballs.

	See also automake bug#9822.

	* lib/missing: Don't try to specially wrap `tar' invocations
	anymore.
	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR): In the definitions of the `AMTAR'
	variable, do not wrap the `tar' invocation with the `missing'
	script anymore.  Instead, allow the user to override the intended
	tar program at make runtime, by defining the `TAR' environment
	variable.
	[$1 == v7]: Similarly for the definitions of the `am__tar' and
	`am__untar' variables.  Since we are at it, don't make them depend
	anymore on the definition of the obsolescent `AMTAR' variable.
	* NEWS: Update.

	parallel-tests: avoid trailing backslashes in make recipes

	The new testsuite-harness could generate recipes with a trailing
	backslash character (possibly followed by blank characters only),
	in the very common case where the user hadn't defined the special
	$(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT) variable.  This caused spurious syntax
	errors with at least older bash versions (e.g., bash 2.05b), and
	could be potentially unportable to other weaker shells.

	dist: obsolete support for lzma (superseded by xz and lzip)

	The lzma utilities are today superseded by the xz utilities; in
	fact, the official site at <http://tukaani.org/lzma/> reads:

	  ``LZMA Utils are legacy data compression software with high
	    compression ratio.  LZMA Utils are no longer developed, ...
	    Users of LZMA Utils should move to XZ Utils.''

	and the existing automake manual (as of 1.11.2) already says:

	  ``dist-xz
	    Generate an 'xz' tar archive of the distribution. xz archives
	    are frequently smaller than bzip2-compressed archives. The 'xz'
	    format will soon (early 2009) displace the 'lzma' format''

	Also, the `dist-lzma' target still suffers of never-solved bugs,
	due to the too-high compression ratio its uses by default, which
	might cause an unacceptable memory consumption when one tries to
	compress or, worse, decompress the created tarballs; see also:

	Many maintainer checks in the top-level Makefile.am did some

	test defs: more granular overriding of the make program

	Before this change, the only way the user could override the make
	program used in the automake test cases was to override the $MAKE
	variable in the environment.  This had the annoying side effect of
	requiring that, whenever a non-default make program was to be used
	in the test cases, that same make program had to be used to drive
	the execution of the automake testsuite; otherwise, the recursive
	make invocations could pick up $MAKE from the environment, and use
	that instead of re-executing with the correct make.

	So, for example, if one wanted to try how Solaris /usr/ccs/bin/make
	behaved in the automake test cases, he couldn't run the testsuite
	in parallel mode, because that make lacks support for concurrent
	execution of recipes; on fast machines, this easily meant a 4x or
	higher slow-down.

	Once the problem is clear, the solution is pretty simple: allow
	the use of another variable, besides $MAKE, to override the make
	program to be used in the test cases.

	See also commit `v1.11-1318-g3ceeef4', that introduced a more
	general version of this change to the master branch.

	* tests/defs.in: Allow the make implementation to be used by the
	test cases to be overridden by the `$AM_TESTSUITE_MAKE' variable,
	in preference to the `$MAKE' variable.

	to break hyperlinks to our on-line manual.  Unfortunately, these

	maint: autogenerate ChangeLog

	Following the practice set by various other GNU projects, we start
	to automatically generate the ChangeLog file from the git commit
	messages.  This will avoid duplication (as the ChangeLog entries
	were always inserted both in the git commit message and in the
	version-controlled ChangeLog file), and potential problems with
	spurious merge conflicts (which, although greatly mitigated by
	Bruno Haible's `git-merge-changelog' helper program, have never
	been completely solved).

	* ChangeLog: Moved ...
	* ChangeLog.11:... to this.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.
	(gitlog_to_changelog_command, gitlog_to_changelog_options): New
	variables.
	(ChangeLog, am--changelog-regen-hook): New targets.
	* .gitignore: Add ChangeLog.
