	docs: "aclocal --install -I /abs/dir" actually copies files

	This change is for automake bug#8407.

	In the past, there had been some debate and confusion about
	whether "aclocal --install" should copy third-party .m4 files
	in the first directory passed to the `-I' option even when
	such directory was given as an absolute path, or whether it
	was better to do so only for directories specified with a
	relative path.

	The rationale for this latter behaviour was that, before the
	existence of the `ACLOCAL_PATH' variable, the only way (a poor
	way, I might add) for a common user to extend the search path
	of a system-wide installation of aclocal was to export something
	like ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /my/extra/macros" in the environment.
	Today, the correct way to proceed is undoubtedly through the
	use of ACLOCAL_PATH, so we can settle the question once and for
	all, and start verifying the correct behaviour of `-I' with a
	new test.

	* tests/aclocal-install-absdir.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* doc/automake.texi (aclocal Options): Be more explicit about
	this part of `--install' semantics.

	docs: fix node names for automake and aclocal invocations

	With the older node names, an "info automake" command issued
	from the command line would have opened the node about the
	invocation of the automake program, rather than the Top node
	of the automake documentation.  To invoke the Top node, one
	had to issue the command "info Automake" instead (note the
	different capitalization).  This was suboptimal, and certainly
	confusing.

	With this change, "info automake" will open the Top node of the
	automake documentation; to access the nodes about the invocation
	of the automake and aclocal program, one has now to issue "info
	automake-invocation" and "info aclocal-invocation" respectively.

	This change fixes automake bug#8071.

	See also commits `v2.61a-22-ge9215d1' and `v2.61a-72-g8c07b48' in
	the autoconf git repository, which tackled a similar issue.

	cases.  Related simplifications.
	Remove the temporary files used in a sanity check as soon as they
	are not needed anymore.
	Do not capture also the standard error of configure: we only want
	to grep its standard output.

	silent-rules: fallback for makes without nested vars

	This fixes two problems reported for Automake (Bug#9928, Bug#10237)
	and is in response to a bug report for building coreutils on HP
	NonStop OS (Bug#10234).  The problem is that HP NonStop 'make'
	treats a line like "AM_V_CC = $(am__v_CC_$(V))" as one that
	expands a macro with the funny name am__v_CC_$(V instead of the
	desired name am__v_CC_1 or am__v_CC_0, and since the funny macro
	is not defined the line is equivalent to "AM_V_CC = )"; this
	inserts a stray ")" when $(AM_V_CC) is used, which eventually
	causes 'make' to fail.

	The basic idea is that instead of generating Makefile.in lines like
	"AM_V_CC = $(am__v_CC_$(V))", we generate
	"AM_V_CC = $(am__v_CC_@AM_V@)".  We then AC_SUBST $(V) for @AM_V@
	in the usual case where `make' supports nested variables,
	and substitute 1 (or 0) otherwise.  Similarly for usages like
	$(am__v_CC_$(AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY)).

	With this change, make implementations that doesn't grasp nested
	variable expansions will still be able to run Makefiles generated
	using the silent-rules option.  They won't allow the user to
	override the make verbosity at runtime through redefinition of
	$(V) (as in "make V=0"); but this is still an improvement over not
	being able to work at all.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* automake.in (define_verbose_var): When defining the variables,
	use @AM_V@ rather than $(V), and use @AM_DEFAULT_V@ rather than
	$(AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY).
	* doc/automake.texi (Automake silent-rules Option): Explain new system.
	* m4/silent.m4 (AM_SILENT_RULES): Check whether `make' supports

	tests: one more fixlet for gettext macros requirement
	* tests/gettext-macros.test (configure.in): Add calls to
	AC_INIT and AC_PROG_CC, to avoid a spurious failure in the
	later aclocal invocation.
	Luckily, this wart wasn't causing any spurious SKIP or FAIL,

	to some aclocal invocations in the gettext tests.

	tests: fix handling of gettext macros requirement

	The code introduced in the earlier change `v1.11-581-gb7d67d5'
	and aimed at automatically fetching all the .m4 files provided by
	gettext has proven inadequate, since it hasn't managed to truly
	and always get *all* the required .m4 files.  For example, it has
	failed to fetch the file `intldir.m4' (present in gettext 0.18.1,
	and where the macro `AM_GNU_GETTEXT_INTL_SUBDIR' is defined),
	which in turn has caused spurious SKIPs of at least the test
	`gettext3.test'.

	The reason for this debacle is that autopoint looks at the version
	specified in AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION to decide which version of the
	gettext infrastructure to bring in; since we were unconditionally
	specifying the older 0.10.35 version, the newer `.m4' files weren't
	brought in.

	* tests/gettext-macros.test: In AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION, instead
	of unconditionally specifying the older 0.10.35 version, specify
	the version of the available `gettextize' or `autopoint' program,
	dynamically extracted with the help of ...
	(extract_program_version):... this new function, and saved ...
	($autopoint_version): ... in this new variable.

	Originally, I myself had insisted on adding those "FIXME" comments

	I did that with the expectation that we could have easily and soon
	added a whitelisting capability to our maintainer-specific syntax
	checks.  This hasn't been the case unfortunately, and now those
	"FIXME" in the comments are just distracting noise, making it more
	difficult to grep the test cases for stuff that could really use a

	tests: better handling of gettext and libtool requirements

	This change fixes automake bug#9807.

	Before this change, the automake testsuite only looked for the
	`.m4' files containing libtool and gettext macros definitions in
	the directory `${prefix}/share/aclocal' (and in the directories
	specified by the `dirlist' file in there, if any), where ${prefix}
	was the configure-time automake installation prefix (defaulting
	to `/usr/local').

	This approach had various shortcomings and disadvantages.  Let's
	briefly describe the three major ones.

	First, on most GNU/Linux systems, a libtool or gettext installed
	from distro-provided packages (e.g., by dpkg on Debian/Ubuntu, or
	by rmp on RedHat/Fedora) would have `/usr', not `/usr/local', as
	its ${prefix}; so, trying to run the automake testsuite with a
	simple "./configure && make && make check" would have failed to
	execute the libtool and gettext tests on most GNU/Linux distros.
	It's true that it was quite easy to work around this issue, by
	creating a proper `/usr/local/share/aclocal/dirlist' file with
	an entry pointing to `/usr/share/aclocal' (a workaround in fact
	used by most automake developers); but the typical user wasn't
	aware of the necessity of this trick, so the libtool and gettext
	tests was usually skipped on testsuite runs "in the wild", thus
	needlessly reducing coverage.

	Second, the older testsuite behaviour made more difficult for
	the developers to run the testsuite with non-default libtool or
	gettext.  For example, assume the developer is working on a system
	that has a default libtool version 1.5 installed in the /usr/local
	hierarchy; to improve coverage, the developer installs also a more
	modern libtool version, say 2.4, in its home directory, let's say
	in ~/libtool-2.4; he then tries to run the automake testsuite with
	this more modern libtool by doing an (apparently) simple:
	  $ PATH=$HOME/libtool-2.4:$PATH make check
	But the automake testsuite would still look for libtool macros in
	/usr/local/share/aclocal, not in ~/libtool-2.4/share/aclocal, so
	the wrong version of the macros would be picked up, and the tests
	would either fail spuriously or (which would be worse) pass without
	truly covering the libtool version the developers was thinking to
	be testing with.
	Worse again, the automake testsuite would *unconditionally* look
	for libtool macros in /usr/local/share/aclocal, so even something
	like:
	  $ export ACLOCAL_PATH=$HOME/libtool-2.4/share/aclocal
	  $ PATH=$HOME/libtool-2.4:$PATH make check
	wouldn't work.

	Third and last, during a "make distcheck", automake is configured
	with a ${prefix} pointing to a proper subdirectory of the build
	directory (usually `pwd`/_inst), which gets created on-the-fly;
	in this case, with the old approach, the automake testsuite never
	found the libtool and gettext macro files, ans so the libtool and
	gettext tests was *always* skipped in a "make distcheck".

	* tests/libtool-macros.test: New helper test, looking (with the
	help of the `libtoolize' script) for libtool macro files required
	by most libtool tests, and making them easily accessible.
	* tests/gettext-macros.test: New helper test, looking (with the
	help of the `libtoolize' script) for libtool macro files required
	by most libtool tests, and making them easily accessible.

	of `libtool-macros.test' and `gettext-macros.test'.

	tests: report useful system information in 'test-suite.log'
	It has already happened various times that a user has run the
	automake testsuite, experienced a failure, read the messages
	telling him "See tests/test-suite.log" and "Please report to
	bug-automake@gnu.org", and done exactly that -- sending us only
	the contents of `tests/test-suite.log', which are usually not
	enough to start debugging the reported failure.  So we have to
	ask him for more details, and usually also for the `config.log'
	file generated by configure.  It's time to fix this recurring
	feedback inefficiency.  We do so by creating a dummy test case
	that takes care of copying the contents of `config.log', plus
	other useful system information, in the final `test-suite.log'.
	* tests/get-sysconf.test: New test, gathering system information
	and then always terminating with a SKIP, so that its output gets
	copied in `test-suite.log'.

	devel: help in comparing Makefile.in from different commits
	Now that the generated Makefile.in, configure and aclocal.m4 files
	are no longer committed in Automake's git repository, a simple
	"git diff" or "git log" no longer shows if and how a change in
	Automake results in changes to the Makefile.in files and/or
	configure script of its own build system.  Still, the ability to
	peek so easily at such differences has proved itself quite useful
	in the past, often revealing inconsistencies and blunders, and
	sometimes even bugs; so it would be a pity to lose that altogether.
	With this change, we add a new maintainer recipe that re-introduces
	much of that capability, by generating and comparing on the fly the
	Makefile.in, configure and aclocal.m4 derived from two arbitrary
	commits of the Automake repository.
	* Makefile.am (autodiffs, compare-autodiffs): New phony targets.

	repo: don't commit generated files in the git repository anymore
	It has been quite some time since autoconf and libtool have stopped
	committing the generated autotools files in their git repositories,
	with no significant ill effects we're aware of.  It's true that the
	autoconf bootstrap process has now the minor annoyance that a
	pre-installed autoconf is required to complete it; but luckily
	automake will not have a similar annoyance, since our bootstrap
	script take care, through some hoops, to use the very automake and
	aclocal versions from the current git checkout to generate the
	required aclocal.m4 and Makefile.in files.  In fact, this has been
	a necessity also in the past, because automake has been known to
	use in its own build system new development features that hadn't
	been present in any previously released automake distribution.
	* .gitignore: Ignore configure, aclocal.m4, and all the
	Makefile.in files.
	* configure.ac (AC_PREREQ): New macro call, to require the
	latest autoconf (2.68 for the moment).

	missing: don't try to re-run tar with a munged command line
	* lib/missing: If the default `tar' program fails with the given

	default `tar' with a munged command line (e.g., ditching possibly
	unportable options), as that could be subtly alter the intended
	semantics (and maybe even create a somewhat corrupted tarball).
	Also, it's worth noting that the main purpose of the `missing'
	script is to allow a non-developer to build the package in the
	face of slightly-skewed timestamps, not to provide wrappers for
	all the maintainer tools -- so we don't have to try too hard
	when `missing' is just called to wrap `tar'.

	yacc/lex tests: avoid too much failures with FreeBSD make

	In various Yacc/Lex tests, we used to run "make distcheck" commands
	whose value was mostly dubious, and, even when it was there, was
	very, very little.  The presence of these extra distchecks had two
	disadvantages: it slowed down our already-too-slow testsuite even
	more, and, much worse, caused a lot of extra failures with FreeBSD,
	all due to automake bug#7884, which is already exposed by the test
	case `yacc-dist-nobuild.test'.

	We can improve this situation by simply removing "make distcheck"
	calls from a few testcases, or making them conditional to the use
	of GNU make.

	dist-xz, dist-bzip2: don't hard-code -9, honor envvar settings
	Before the present change, automake-generated `dist-xz' rule used
	a hard-coded `xz -9'.  That was a problem because on this front,
	xz differs from gzip and bzip2.  While the latter two don't incur
	any run-time decompression penalty for using a higher compression
	level, specifying -9 with xz imposes a potentially fatal virtual
	memory requirement on any client that wants to decompress your
	tar.xz file.
	People have complained that a tarball compressed with -9 cannot
	be uncompressed in a low-memory environment (wrt-based embedded).
	Hence, instead of defaulting to -9, which is useful only for very
	large tarballs, it defaults to -e (equivalent to -6e).  This
	limits the default memory requirements imposed on decompressors,
	yet still gives very good compression ratios.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz): Do not hard-code xz's -9: that made
	it impossible to override.  Actually don't default to -9, either,
	since that induced inordinately large virtual memory usage when
	merely decompressing.  Instead, use its XZ_OPT envvar, defaulting
	to -e if not defined.  Suggested by Lasse Collin.
	(dist-bzip2): Similarly, do not hard-code -9, but do continue to
	use -9 by default.  Honor the BZIP2 envvar.

	tests: fix spurious failures due to missing 'yywrap()' function

	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a `yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with `-ll' and `-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.

	This behaviour is intended; the Autoconf manual reads:
	 ``You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	   both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source it
	   produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability, however,
	   you must either provide a function `yywrap' or, if you don't use
	   it (e.g., your scanner has no `#include'-like feature), simply
	   include a `%noyywrap' statement in the scanner's source.''

	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of
	the Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing `yywrap' (this happens for example on Fedora-based
	systems).   The proper workaround is to simply provide a fall-back
	implementation of `yywrap' in our lexers.

	See also partially-overlapping commit `v1.11-871-geb147a1' (from
	the 'testsuite-work' branch), which was motivated by similar
	spurious failures experienced when cross-compiling.

2011-11-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: testsuite is now safe to run with dmake in parallel mode
	* tests/defs.in: Unset variables DMAKE_CHILD, DMAKE_DEF_PRINTED
	and DMAKE_MAX_JOBS, which are exported by Solaris dmake when run
	in parallel mode, and which might confuse make processes spawned
	by our testsuite.

2011-11-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failures w.r.t. parallel make and colorization
	* tests/color2.test: Skip the test if the $MAKE program fails to
	consider the standard output as a tty when spawned by `expect'.
	This is required for make implementations, like FreeBSD make and
	Solaris dmake, that redirect the output of recipes to temporary
	files or pipes when run in parallel mode.  Since we are at it,
	simplify the detection of a working `expect' program, and throw
	in other minor simplifications.

	info: allow user to inhibit creation/update of '${infodir}/dir'
	With this change, we allow the user to request the install-info
	rules not to update the `${infodir}/dir' file, by setting the
	environment variable `AM_UPDATE_INFO_DIR' to the value "no".
	This is especially useful to distro packagers, and is a definite
	improvement over our previous hack of looking whether the
	`install-info' program was the Debian or GNU version -- hack
	which had been silently broken with recent versions of debian
	install-info BTW (probably since dpkg 1.15.4, 2009-09-06).
	This change fixes automake bug#9773.  See also Debian Bug#543992.
	* lib/am/texinfos.am: Don't look anymore at the output of
	`install-info --version' to decide whether to use it to update

	That commit had caused the bugs #8485 and #8526.  Since we are
	nearing the bug-fixing automake release 1.11.2, the safest policy
	at the moment is to just revert the problematic hunks: an older,

	tests: fix spurious failures due to missing 'yywrap()' function

	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a `yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with `-ll' and `-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.

	This behaviour is intended; the Autoconf manual reads:
	 ``You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	   both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source it
	   produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability, however,
	   you must either provide a function `yywrap' or, if you don't use
	   it (e.g., your scanner has no `#include'-like feature), simply
	   include a `%noyywrap' statement in the scanner's source.''

	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of
	the Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing `yywrap' (this happens for example on Fedora-based
	systems).   The proper workaround is to simply provide a fall-back
	implementation of `yywrap' in our lexers.

	See also partially-overlapping commit `v1.11-871-geb147a1' (from
	the 'testsuite-work' branch), which was motivated by similar
	spurious failures experienced when cross-compiling.

	dist: separate auxiliary file instantiation from DIST_COMMON update
	This change simplifies the automake internals dealing with the
	checking, copying and distributing of required auxiliary files.
	With this change, a required auxiliary file is *unconditionally*
	added to the contents of the DIST_COMMON variable in the generated
	Makefile.in, before checking whether it exists, or trying to copy
	it (if `--add-missing' is in use).  This shouldn't be a problem,
	since if the checking or copying of the file fails, automake will
	bail out, the Makefile.in won't be created, and thus its content
	will not matter.  OK, this is not completely true when threaded
	automake is in use, but then, such a situation was also possible
	before this patch, so no regression here, which is enough for us.
	This change is the first of a series of steps aimed at fixing
	the regression introduced in threaded automake usage by commit
	`v1.11-1219-g326ecba'.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Add the required file to
	DIST_COMMON unconditionally.
	* tests/missing-auxfile-stops-makefiles-creation.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2011-10-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	dist: simplify automake code accordingly to the previous changes
	After the previous change `v1.11-1219-g326ecba', every Makefile.am
	requiring a file in the "config auxdir" will cause it to be listed
	in the DIST_COMMON variable of the corresponding generated
	Makefile.in, not only of the top-level Makefile.in.  Thus we don't
	need to worry anymore about trying to distribute files in the
	config auxdir from the top-level Makefile or the Makefile in
	config auxdir (if any).  This allows us to carry out some useful
	simplifications in the automake script.
	This will however cause some changes in the generated Makefile;
	for example, if the `PROGRAMS' primary is used only in a subdir
	Makefile.am, the `depcomp' script will be distributed only by
	`subdir/Makefile', not by the top-level Makefile.  This change
	can be seen as an internal detail though, and definitely warranted
	by the nice simplifications the current commit provides.
	* automake.in ($automake_will_process_aux_dir): Variable removed.
	(scan_autoconf_files): Adjust and simplify.
	(handle_makefiles_threaded): Likewise.
	(get_number_of_threads): Likewise.
	(require_file_internal): Likewise.
	(maybe_push_required_file): Its return value is not used anymore,
	so return nothing.  Add special handling for distributed files from
	`$config_libobj_dir'.  Also, catch "this can't happen" situations,
	and abort accordingly.  Fix function description to better fit its
	new role.
	* tests/libobj19.test: Extend to also check situations where the
	Makefile.am using $(LIBOBJS) is not the top-level one.
	* tests/distcom6.test: Delete, merged into ...
	* tests/distcom2.test: ... this test, which has been update to

2011-10-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	dist: auxiliary files can be distributed from subdir Makefiles
	With this change, we make it possible for a subdir Makefile.am
	to distribute files in the config auxdir; while this means that
	some files might be copied multiple times, it simplify some logic
	in the automake script, and fix at least one important bug.  In
	fact, before this change, the auxiliary script `test-driver' was
	not being distributed as expected when TESTS was defined only in
	a subdir Makefile (which is a pretty common setup indeed).  Now
	this does not happen anymore: so the present change fixes automake
	bug#9546.
	Another welcome collateral effect is that `dist-auxfile-2.test'
	now passes.
	OTOH, the present changes *breaks threaded automake*.  The reason
	is that automake needs to serialize file installations spawned
	by `--add-missing' (this isn't for cosmetic reasons, but is
	really needed to avoid possible race conditions and botched output
	files).  Currently the code that installs required files is
	intertwined with the code that declares the DIST_COMMON variables;
	so, upon de-serialization, the definition of DIST_COMMON might get
	emitted in the wrong Makefile.in.
	Some follow-up refactoring in automake will soon take care of
	remedying this situation.  For the moment, we just declare some
	"parallel-am" tests as xfailing.
	* automake.in (maybe_push_required_file): Add ad-hoc handling for
	the case where the directory part of the required file is different
	from the subdir where the current Makefile.am resides, but is equal
	to the "config-aux directory" ($config_auxdir).  This is needed to
	allow a construct in a non-top-level Makefile.am to require a file
	in the config-aux directory.
	* tests/test-driver-is-distributed.test: Extend and adjust.  This
	test now passes.
	* tests/java-compile-run-nested.test: Call automake with the `-a'

	parallel-tests: don't allow @substitutions@ in TEST_EXTENSIONS
	Even after the last commit `v1.11-476-g90bea64', the checks
	performed by automake on entries in $(TEST_EXTENSIONS) tried to
	allow for @substitited@ stuff.  This however ends up allowing
	quite brittle setups, which, most importantly, are of no real
	practical usefulness anyway.  So it's better to just disallow
	@substitutions@ in TEST_EXTENSIONS altogether, offering a clear
	error message, instead of risking weird bugs and unexpected
	behaviors in the generated Makefile.in.
	* automake.in ($TEST_EXTENSION_PATTERN): Turned from a regular

	tap/awk: handle exit statuses > 256 (seen on few korn shells)
	Some Korn shells, when a child process die due to signal number
	n, can leave in $? an exit status of 256+n instead of the more
	standard 128+n.  Apparently, both behaviours are allowed by
	POSIX, so be prepared to handle them both.
	This change has been motivated by a testsuite failure on Debian
	with the AT&T Korn Shell version 93u-1.

	aclocal: more granularity in acdir overriding
	Before this change, using the `--acdir' option caused aclocal to
	redefine both the directory of automake-provided m4 macros and the
	directory of third-party system-wide m4 macros.  With this change,
	we deprecate the `--acdir' aclocal option, and introduce two new
	options `--automake-acdir' and `--system-acdir', to allow for more
	granularity.
	* aclocal.in (@automake_includes, @system_includes,
	@user_includes): Fix and extend comments.
	(usage): Update.
	(handle_acdir_option): New function.
	(parse_arguments): Recognize new options `--system-acdir' and
	`automake-acdir', and handle `--acdir' using the new function
	above.  Simplify logic by assuming that the directory of
	third-party system-wide m4 files always exists.
	* tests/aclocal.in: Update to use the new options, instead of
	the deprecated. `--acdir'.
	* m4/dirlist: Move ...

	(dist_system_ac_DATA): New, defined to an empty value; this will
	ensure that the $(system_acdir) directory will be created by
	"make install".
	* tests/aclocal.test: Remove check about the `--print-ac-dir'
	option of aclocal, it has been moved into ...
	* tests/aclocal-print-acdir.test: ... this new test, and quite

	testsuite: revamp generation of autogenerated tests
	With this change, we make generated tests be real scripts again
	-- albeit only thin layers around the tests they wrap.  It turned
	out that the apparently clever tricks we played by having lots
	of custom (and auto-generated) `..._LOG_COMPILER' variables and
	by having the tests in $(wrap_TESTS) not being real on-file-system
	scripts caused more pain and confusion than expected, for only
	marginal gains.  Also, that previous setup didn't interact very
	well with "make check RECHECK_LOGS=", since the log files for
	the "wrappee" tests were always considered out-of-date (which in
	hindsight is natural, since these log files depended on wrappee
	tests that didn't exist -- and weren't created).  And finally, it
	wasn't possible to easily and naturally run the wrappee tests
	from the command line -- definitely harmful for debugging and
	sanity checking.
	* tests/gen-wrap-tests: Deleted, its role subsumed into ...
	* tests/gen-tests-deps: ... this script, with the help of
	(unindent, atomic_write, build_matcher, write_wrapper_script,
	%test_generators): ... these new functions and variables.
	Other few minor fixlets and improvements.
	* tests/wrap-tests.sh: Delete, not needed anymore.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/wrap-tests.am): Don't generate
	nor include anymore.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Update.
	(wrap_TESTS): Renamed to ...
	(generated_TESTS): ... this.
	($(generated_TESTS)): Must have the same dependencies of

2011-09-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/perl: be more portable to older TAP::Parser versions
	* lib/tap-driver.pl (start): Do not call the `ignore_exit' method

	automake: fix regression due to de-ansification support removal
	The last change `v1.11-947-g136b489' removed code that automake
	was using to decide whether binary objects were built by the
	generated Makefile.in, so that it could avoid to emit unneeded

	again.

	tests: prefer AM_... variables to user-reserved ones in Makefile

2011-08-29  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: some minor fixlets w.r.t. TAP-based tests
	The variable that is used by our test scripts to decide whether
	they are "plain" or TAP-based is `using_tap'; however, some
	peripheral sanity checks and sanitization code in our testsuite
	were erroneously using the `use_tap' variable instead.  Fix that.
	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Nullify `using_tap',
	not `use_tap'.
	* tests/defs-static.in: Check that `using_tap', not `use_tap',
	is not exported.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update.

	tests: avoid re-running a test with the 'parallel-tests' option
	* tests/backcompat5.test (parallel_tests): Define to "no", to
	prevent the generation of a sibling test script that uses the
	'parallel-tests' driver.  That would be useless anyway, since
	we manually override the contents of configure.in, thus clobbering
	the `parallel-tests' option in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

	testsuite: different test scripts cannot share the same basename
	If two test scripts have the same basename, they will end up
	sharing the same log file, leading to all sort of undefined and
	undesired behaviours.  Add a Makefile check verifying that this

	* tests/test-logs-repeated.test: New test, verifying previously

2011-08-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure for awk implementation of TAP driver
	* tests/tap-realtime.test: The awk+shell implementation of the TAP
	driver must "read ahead" of one line in order to catch the exit
	status of the test script it runs.  So, in the TAP-producer script
	here, be sure to echo one "dummy" line after each TAP result line
	in order not to cause false positives.

2011-08-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: allow escaping of TAP directives
	* lib/tap-driver.sh (setup_result_obj): Handle escaping of TAP
	directives in a way tat is (mostly) compatible by what is done
	by the TAP::Parser module.
	With this change, the tests `tap-escape-directive.test' and
	`tap-escape-directive-2.test' now also pass with the shell/awk
	implementation of the TAP driver.

2011-08-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2011-08-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: improve syncing between awk+shell and perl implementations
	* lib/tap-driver.pl (stringify_test_result): Renamed ...
	(stringify_result_obj): ... to this.  Break up a clause in the
	long "if/elsif/.../else" construct to avoid unaesthetic line
	breaks and to be more synced with the sibling function in
	`tap-driver.sh'.  Rename the `$result', `$PASS' and `$FAIL'
	variables to respectively `$result_obj', `$COOKED_PASS' and

	sibling code in `tap-driver.sh'.
	Other minor cosmetic and typo fixes.
	* lib/tap-driver.sh (extract_tap_comment): Remove outdated
	"FIXME" comments.
	(get_global_test_result): Small reordering to make it better

	tap/perl: don't redirect perl warnings/errors to log files
	With this change, the test `tap-driver-stderr.test' also passes

	`OLDERR' file handle, and call ...
	(trap_perl_warnings_and_errors): ... this new function, trapping
	the `__WARN__' and `__DIE__' "pseudo-signals" to ensure that the
	warning and error messages goes to that original stderr stream.
	Since we are at it, be sure to prepend all possible "die" message
	with the name of the script as given by the `$ME' variable.

2011-08-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/perl: add copyright notice, version string, and emacs stuff
	* lib/tap-driver.pl: Add proper copyright notice and bug reporting

	the date-based script version saved into the `$VERSION' variable.
	($VERSION): Define to the current UTC date.

2011-08-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: don't redirect awk stderr to log files
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Handle the file descriptors redirections
	more smartly, to avoid sending error messages from awk (about
	e.g. syntax or I/O errors) to the log files instead that to the
	console.
	* tests/tap-driver-stderr.test: New test, verifying the improved
	driver behaviour.  Notice that this test still fails when using
	the perl implementation of the TAP driver.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tap_other_tests): Update.

2011-08-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: remove obsolete "FIXME" comment
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Remove obsolete "FIXME" comment about our

	tap/awk: handle non-zero exit status from the test command
	* lib/tap-driver.sh (get_test_exit_message): New function in the
	awk script, used to extract the exit status of the test program,
	or at least a good guess of it.
	(write_test_results): Use it, reporting an ERROR result if it
	detects that the test program exited with a non-zero status.
	* tests/tap-signal.test: Account for the differences in the
	error messages generated by the awk and perl TAP drivers.  Fix
	an unrelated typo in comments since we are at it.

2011-08-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: prepare to fetch the exit status of the test command
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Rewrite some logic in the main parsing loop,

2011-08-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: refactor for future changes
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Rewrite the awk script so that the parsing

	* tests/tap-html.test ($required): Require `rst2html'.

2011-08-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: support Solaris /usr/xpg4/bin/awk
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Use `\t', not `\\t', to represent tabulation
	character in regexps, even when inside double-quoted strings; that
	seems to be more portable to Solaris 10 XPG4 awk.

2011-08-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: support Solaris /usr/bin/nawk
	* lib/tap-driver.sh (close_or_die): Remove, the use of the `close'
	builtin in there was confusing /usr/bin/nawk from Solaris 10 into
	a syntax error.
	(write_test_results): Simply use `close' on the `*.trs' file, that
	should be enough.

2011-08-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: correctly extract message from SKIP plans
	* lib/tap-driver.sh (/^1\.\.0+[ \t]*#/): Add a forgotten `?' to
	the regex used to extract the skip message from a "1..0" TAP plan.
	* tests/planskip.test: Check for the just-fixed bug.
	* tests/tap-planskip-unplanned-corner.test: Don't be too strict
	w.r.t. the formatting of the "skip whole test" message, to avoid
	failing due to bugs irrelevant for this test (like the one just
	fixed).

2011-08-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap/awk: support colorized output
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Pass definition of colors to the BEGIN block
	of the awk script, using ...
	($init_colors): ... this new variable, which supersedes ...
	($red, $grn, $lgn, $blu, $mgn, $std): ... these variables, which
	have been consequently removed.
	($color_tests): We don't have to pass this anymore to the awk
	script, so do not convert it to a numeric boolean.
	(decorate_result): Implement for real.
	With this change, the test 'tap-color.test' now passes.

2011-08-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: real (but still incomplete) awk implementation of TAP driver
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: Add an incomplete, but mostly working,
	implementation of a TAP parser and driver in awk.  It doesn't yet
	support colorized output, fetching of exit status from test
	programs, nor a way to escape TAP directives in TAP result lines,
	but passes all the tests of TAP support in the automake testsuite,
	apart from the following ones:
	  - tap-color.test
	  - tap-escape-directive.test
	  - tap-exit.test
	  - tap-missing-plan-and-bad-exit.test
	  - tap-passthrough-exit.test
	  - tap-planskip-badexit.test
	  - tap-planskip-unplanned-corner.test
	  - tap-signal.test
	Tested on Debian GNU/Linux with GNU awk 3.1.7 and 3.0.2, "original
	awk" 2010-05-23-1, and mawk 1.3.3-15 (with which also the test
	`tap-realtime.test' fails, in addition to those listed above).

2011-08-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2011-08-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	coverage: some more tests on corner cases of TAP support
	* tests/tap-no-spurious.test: Extend checks verifying that a line
	matching, say, the regex "^ok[a-zA-Z0-9_]" is *not* considered a
	TAP result.
	* tests/tap-no-spurious-numbers.test: New test, checking that our
	TAP driver doesn't spuriously recognize as TAP result numbers what
	is not (even if it seems pretty close).
	* tests/tap-negative-numbers.test: New test, checking that our
	TAP driver doesn't spuriously recognize negative TAP result
	numbers, but correctly interprets them as test descriptions
	instead.
	* tests/tap-plan-leading-zero.test, tap-numbers-leading-zero.test:
	New tests, checking how our driver fares in recognizing numbers
	with leading zeroes in TAP results or TAP plans.

	testsuite: various fixlets and tweakings
	* tests/seenc.test: Make grepping of automake stderr stricter.
	Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/symlink.test: Likewise.  Also, define `$am_create_testdir'
	to "empty" to avoid bringing in unused auxiliary files (only to
	have to remove them right away), and use proper m4 quoting in
	`configure.in'.
	* tests/vpath.test: Make grepping of generated `Makefile.in'
	slightly stricter.  Prefer trailing `:' over trailing `Exit 0'.
	* tests/suffix6c.test: Unset OBJEXT to avoid interferences from
	the environment.
	* tests/suffix12.test: Do not whitespace-indent `##' comments
	when they are embedded in a makefile rule: having them indented
	is not part of the Automake API, and might cause failures with
	e.g., Tru64 make.
	* tests/syntax.test: Simplify the `Makefile.am' to ensure that
	automake doesn't fail for the wrong reasons.  Make grepping of
	automake stderr slightly stricter.
	* tests/test-harness-vpath-rewrite.test: Remove useless variable
	definition from `Makefile.am'.
	* tests/test-driver-custom-multitest.test: Fix typo in comments.
	* tests/self-check-me.tap: Fix minor typo in test description.

2011-08-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: no more spurious successes for FreeBSD make
	Work around a bug of FreeBSD make bug that was causing the
	automake-generated "check" target to complete with success
	even if some tests failed; this happened only when FreeBSD
	make was run in concurrent mode (as in, e.g., "make -j2
	check").  The bug is not present in NetBSD make.
	This change fixes automake bug#9245:
	 <https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9245>
	See also FreeBSD PR bin/159730:
	 <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=159730>
	* lib/am/check.am [%?PARALLEL_TESTS%] $(TEST_SUITE_LOG): Use a
	more "safe" (and apparently redundant) idiom to exit with error,
	so that the non-zero exit status is picked up also by FreeBSD
	make when it's running in concurrent mode.
	* NEWS: Update.

2011-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: correctly handle string "0" in TAP messages
	* lib/tap-driver.pl (is_null_string): New function, can be used
	to determine whether a given string variable is empty or undefined.
	Useful to avoid pitfalls like:
	  if ($message) { print "$message\n"; }
	which wouldn't print anything if $message is the literal "0".
	(handle_tap_test, handle_tap_plan, handle_tap_bailout): Use it,
	to avoid missing messages composed only by a literal "0" in TAP
	result descriptions and in skip, todo and bailout explanations.
	* tests/tap-message-0.test: Enhance.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove it, it passes now.

2011-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: a minor simplification in the perl TAP driver
	* lib/tap-driver.pl: The `--disable-hard-errors' option is a

2011-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: fix help screen for test driver scripts

	($scriptversion): Update.

2011-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: add a dummy TAP driver script implemented in shell + awk
	The user can also now decide which implementation of the TAP driver
	to use in the testsuite by defining the `$am_tap_implementation'
	variable to either "perl" or "shell".  Future enhancements will
	allow the testsuite to automatically run the test scripts on TAP
	support with both the TAP driver implementations, to improve
	coverage.
	* tests/defs (fetch_tap_driver): Honor the `$am_tap_implementation'
	variable to decide which implementation of the TAP driver to fetch.
	($am_tap_implementation): Default to "perl".
	* tests/tap-common-setup.test: Do not fetch the TAP driver, the
	code in tap-setup.sh does that already (and respecting runtime
	overriding of `$am_tap_implementation').
	* lib/tap-driver: Renamed ...
	* lib/tap-driver.pl: ... to this, and ...
	($ME): ... adjusted this.
	* doc/automake.texi: Adjust to the renaming.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TAP_LOG_DRIVER): Likewise.
	* tests/tap-doc2.test: Likewise.
	* lib/tap-driver.sh: New script, still mostly dummy.
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist_script_DATA): Update, and since we are at
	it, rewrite it to make it easier to add new entries in the future.

2011-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: refactor tests on TAP support in view of future changes
	* tests/defs (fetch_tap_driver): New subroutine; it fetches the
	automake-provided TAP driver from the `lib/' directory into the
	current directory, and edits its shebang line so that it will be
	run with the perl interpreter determined at configure time.
	* tests/tap-setup.sh: Use it.
	* tests/tap-common-setup.test: There's no need to AC_SUBST `PERL'
	anymore, nor to use it in the Makefile to run the TAP driver.
	Also, use the `fetch_tap_driver' function instead of copying the
	`tap-driver' auxiliary script directly.

	tap: improve diagnosing and reporting of plan mismatches
	Problem exposed by a failure in the test 'tap-plan-errors.test'.
	* lib/tap-driver (NO_PLAN, EARLY_PLAN, LATE_PLAN): New constants.
	(Throughout the file): Use more complex semantics for `$plan_seen',

	* lib/tap-driver ($bailed_out): New global boolean variable,
	telling whether a "Bail out!" directive has been seen or not.
	(handle_tap_bailout): This function does not anymore stop the
	reading from TAP stream; instead, it sets `$bailed_out' to a

2011-08-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: non-zero exit status after "Bail out!" should not be reported
	This new behaviour is more consistent with that of the `prove'
	utility.  Also, experience with the use of TAP in the Automake's
	own test suite has shown that reporting non-zero exit status from
	a script after it has issued a "Bail out!" directive is mostly
	redundant, more introducing noise rather than conveying useful
	information.
	* lib/tap-driver (finish): Inline the part of it that was getting
	the script exit status ...
	(main): ... in here.
	* tests/tap-bailout-badexit.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tap_with_common_setup_tests): Update.

2011-08-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: a "plan with SKIP" after test results is an error
	This new behaviour is both more natural and more consistent with
	that of the `prove' utility.
	* lib/tap-driver (handle_tap_plan): Do not stop TAP parsing when
	a "plan with SKIP" line (e.g., "1..0 # SKIP") is encountered, and
	do not print a "SKIP" line if some TAP result has already been
	seen.
	* tests/tap-skip-whole.test: Adapt.

	Motivated by a regression in the 'test-protocols' branch.

2011-08-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: avoid confusing SKIP messages for errored tests
	* tests/defs [$use_tap] (exit trap): Don't print the test plan
	in case the client script exited with a non-zero status.  This
	avoids the display of redundant "SKIP" messages for tests with
	lazy plans that error out before any test is run.

2011-08-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: keep more debugging info around in 'add-missing.tap'
	* tests/add-missing.tap: Use a different directory for each test,
	so that in case of failure more information is kept around.
	Since we are at it, remove redundant TAP diagnostic, and define
	`$am_create_testdir' to "empty" to avoid bringing in unused
	auxiliary files.

2011-08-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: more granular count of test results in our TAP library
	* tests/tap-functions.sh ($tap_bad_count_): Removed, superseded
	by ...
	($tap_fail_count_, $tap_xpass_count_): ... these new variables,
	which keep more granular counts.
	($tap_pass_count_: New variable.
	* tests/defs (exit trap): Adjust and simplify accordingly.

2011-08-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fixlets and improvements in two long TAP-based tests
	* tests/depmod.tap: Clean up the subdirectories used by tests that
	passed, to avoid ending up with a too big test directory.  This is
	especially important since, on each and every system, at least some
	tests in this script are expected to be skipped (which ones exactly
	depends on the system), thus causing the test directory not to be
	removed when the script terminates.
	* tests/instspc.tap: Likewise (with the difference that tests here
	are not expected to be skipped, but to xfail).  Give more explicit
	error message in case of setup failure.  Skip the proper number of
	tests when required, to avoid spurious errors due to mismatched
	plan.  Also, really avoid to run the unsupported test cases when
	the need to skip them is detected.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: improvements to our shell TAP library and APIs
	These improvements impact only the Automake's own testsuite.
	* tests/tap-functions.sh (plan_): Allow new special arguments
	"unknown" a.k.a. "later" and "lazy" a.k.a. "now".  Perform
	sanity check the given arguments.  Adjust incorrect comments.
	(lazy_plan_): Removed, superseded by the new version of `plan_'.
	(not): New function, run a command and inverts its exit status.
	(ok_, not_ok_, skip_): These are just shorthands for common
	`result_' usages.
	(xfail_, xpass_, reset_test_count_): Removed, they are not used,
	nor does a legitimate use for them seem in sight.
	(not): New function, to run a command inverting its exit status.
	(command_not_ok_): Removed, superseded by `command_ok_' + `not'.
	(command_ok_): Extended to accept TAP directives.
	* tests/defs (trap): Don't use `late_plan_' anymore, use
	`plan_ "now"' instead.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: convert some `suffix*' tests to TAP
	This will allow us to explicitly declare some expected failures
	involving Solaris make as such, instead of partly papering over
	them with skips and partly letting them fail too loudly.
	* tests/suffix-chain.test: Rename ...
	* tests/suffix-chain.tap: ... to this, and convert to the use of
	TAP.  Also, fix some bugs since we are at it, and ...
	($required): ... require `cc'.

	tests: don't let a known Solaris make bug poison too many tests
	See automake bug#7670 and bug#7824.
	* tests/defs (make_can_chain_suffix_rules): New function, tell
	whether the make implementation in use can chain suffix rules
	automatically or not.
	* tests/suffix3.test: Use it to avoid issuing calls to make that
	are unportable to make implementations that are not smart enough
	to chain suffix rules automatically.
	* tests/suffix8.test: Use it to avoid issuing calls to make that
	* tests/suffix10.test: Use it to avoid issuing calls to make that

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	self tests: avoid spurious output on console, and related fixlets
	* tests/self-check-cleanup.test: Set `$stderr_fileno_' to `2'

	`$stderr_fileno_' in the self tests, not at the global level, it
	is more correct.
	($init): New variable, to reduce code duplication.
	Some refactoring and adjustments to the name of the tests.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: few more sanity checks
	* tests/defs: Catch some more (very unlikely) set-up or internal

	to be a theoretic-only improvement.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: really make them "set -e" clean
	Motivated by a spurious failure of test `instsh3-w.shtst' on
	Solaris 10.
	* tests/defs: Make really "set -e" clean, to avoid spurious
	failures in case this file is sourced by a test script that has
	already set the `errexit' flag.  To be sure we don't regress,
	move the `set -e' call much earlier, and make the comment telling
	about the expected "set -e" cleanliness more loud and outstanding.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	self tests: register an expected failures with Solaris /bin/sh
	Solaris 10 /bin/sh erroneously exit with success right away when
	the following three conditions are met at the same time:
	 1. the `errexit' flag is active,
	 2. an exit trap is installed, and
	 3. a non-existing command is issued.
	* tests/self-exit.tap: When that bug is detected, issue an XFAIL
	rather than a FAIL.  Since we are at it, improve by avoiding
	creation of stray temporary files when testing for non-executable
	commands.

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	gitignore: update and improve for the testsuite files

2011-08-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: test directory creation more configurable
	After this change, the individual tests will be able to tell
	`./defs' whether or not to create a temporary test directory
	for them, and if yes, whether or not to pre-populate it.
	* tests/defs: Only create the temporary test directory if the
	variable `$am_create_testdir' is not set to "no".  In this
	case, only pre-populate it if that variable is not set to
	`$empty'.
	* tests/defs-static.in: Check that `$am_create_testdir' is not
	exported in the environment.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update.
	* tests/self-check-dir.test: Extend, and make deeper and more
	robust.
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Update.
	* tests/autodist.test: Set `$am_create_testdir' instead of
	removing by hand files created by ./defs.
	* tests/tap-doc2.test: Likewise.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: more uses of the `seq_' function

	test defs: fix bug in plain version of `skip_all_'
	* tests/plain-functions.sh (skip_all_): Call `skip_', not `skip'.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: small cleanups and tweakings
	* tests/defs: Where possible, prefer `framework_failure_' or
	`fatal_' to `Exit 99'.  Try to catch more possible hard errors
	and setup failures.  Do not hide expected error messages.  Avoid
	a couple of forks when copying files from `$(top_srcdir)/lib'.
	($signal): Remove, no more needed.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: improve interface for giving early TAP plan
	Since commit `v1.11-976-g4740f56', an early TAP plan can also be
	specified after input lines have already been seen, as long as
	no one of them is a TAP result line.  We can now take advantage
	of this in our own testsuite, allowing the TAP-based scripts to
	specify their earlier plan after having included `./defs'.  In
	particular, this offers the benefit of allowing those scripts to
	issue a "skip all" plan (e.g., "1..0 # SKIP reason ...") after
	the inclusion of `./defs', which wasn't possible with the older
	interface (introduced in commit `v1.11-1114-g0286308').
	* tests/defs: Don't try to call `plan_' if `$planned' is defined,
	the calling scripts can do that directly now.
	* tests/ac-output-old.tap: Use `plan_' directly instead of
	setting `$planned' before including `./defs'.
	* tests/automake-cmdline.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/depmod.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/instspc.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/add-missing.tap: Don't set `$planned'.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: fix bug in TAP version of `skip_all_'
	* tests/tap-functions (skip_all_): Set `$have_tap_plan_' to "yes"
	when called, so that the exit trap won't write another TAP plan.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: fix skip directives to work also with TAP-based tests
	* test/defs: Use `skip_all_', not `skip_', to issue a skip of the
	whole calling test script.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: more environment cleanup
	* tests/defs: Also unset variables AM_COLOR_TESTS and
	AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT.

2011-08-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test harness: more minor VPATH-rewrite issues
	* tests/am/check.am (am__set_TESTS_bases, $(TEST_SUITE_LOGS),
	am--redo-logs, recheck, recheck-html): Cosmetic fixlets to
	minimize the risk of unwanted VPATH rewrites.
	(check-TESTS): Likewise, and normalize trailing whitespace
	since we are at it.
	Bugs exposed by test cases `check6-p.test' and `check7-p.test'.

	test harness: "make -n check" works correctly with Solaris make
	To avoid some recipes being executed with "make -n", we used the
	trick of issuing recursive make calls not directly with $(MAKE),
	but with a simple indirection instead:
	  ...
	  am__stealth_MAKE = $(MAKE)
	  ...
	  target:
	      ... $(am__stealth_MAKE) ...
	  ...
	This hack worked with GNU make, but, unfortunately, not with
	Solaris make.  The present change removes the hack, and uses more
	proper idioms to avoid unwanted recipe executions with "make -n".
	Bug exposed by test case `parallel-tests-dry-run.test'.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__stealth_MAKE): Remove, no more used.
	(.log.trs): Break recipe in multiple shell invocations.
	($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Likewise, and move some corner-case parts of
	the recipe to ...
	(am--redo-logs): ... this new internal helper .PHONY target.

	tests: fix spurious failure with Solaris make
	* tests/distcheck-configure-flags-am.test: Avoid using `+=' too
	liberally with AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS, since the line breaks
	so introduced, in conjunction with single quotes, might confuse
	Solaris make.

	test harness: fixlet in workaround for VPATH rewrite issue
	Fixes a minor in previous commit `v1.11-983-gfda3de5'.

	Issue exposed by test `posixsubst-tests-p.test', and similar to
	the problem solved by commit `v1.11-159-ge7aa360'.
	* lib/am/check.am [%?PARALLEL_TESTS%] (check-TESTS): Trim trailing

	segfault) on Solaris XPG4 make and Heirloom make.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fix weird spurious failure with Solaris /bin/sh
	Solaris /bin/sh, when killed with a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, can
	apparently end up exiting with exit status 208, instead of leaving
	the correct wide exit status to the parent.  See:
	 <http://dbaspot.com/shell/396118-bourne-shell-exit-code-term.html>
	Work around this incompatibility.
	* tap-signal.test: Look for the above Solaris bug.
	(signal_caught): Adapt to handle it.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fix another spurious failure on Solaris make

	output before grepping it, for make implementations that, like
	Solaris' one, print the whole of the failed recipe on failure.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fix two spurious failures on Solaris make
	* tests/tests-environment-and-log-compiler.test: Do not fail if

	(peek_tap_line, unget_tap_line, @tap_lines): Remove, they're not
	used anymore.
	(TAP_PEEKING): Block deleted, all its subroutines and variables
	having been removed.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fix spurious failure in a test on TAP support
	* tests/tap-passthrough-exit.test: When the `--ignore-exit' flag
	of the TAP driver is used, don't look for a message reporting the
	non-zero exit statuses of tests in the log files; such message is
	not expected to be there anymore.  Related simplifications.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: plan location is more liberal w.r.t. non-TAP lines
	With this change, only lines that are TAP results will matter
	w.r.t. the position of the TAP plan in the input; for example,
	this input:
	  this is a non-TAP line
	  # and this a TAP diagnostic line
	  1..1
	  ok 1
	was considered to be an error, diagnosed with a message "test
	plan in middle of output"; as effect of the current change, such
	input is now valid.  This is more consistent with the behaviour
	of the `prove' utility.
	* lib/tap-driver ($lineno): Removed, no more needed.
	($tap_stopped): New global variable.
	(stringify_test_result): Return "ERROR" if a TAP result is found
	when `$tap_stopped' is set to true.
	(handle_tap_test): Diagnose TAP results that comes after a late
	plan.  Add a couple of blank lines, for clarity.
	(handle_tap_plan): Set `$tap_stopped' to true after a late plan
	is encountered.  Do not complain anymore for extra non-TAP lines
	preceding or following the plan.  Adjust comments.
	(main): Don't increment $lineno anymore.
	* tests/tap-plan.test: Extend a bit, and remove stale comment.
	* tests/tap-color.test: Adjust.
	* tests/tap-passthrough.test: Likewise.
	* tests/tap-plan-corner.test: Adjust and extend.
	* tests/tap-plan-errors.test: Likewise.
	* tests/tap-plan-middle.test: New test.
	* tests/tap-plan-corner2.test: Delete, it's obsolete now.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove it.
	(tap_with_common_setup_tests): Likewise, and add
	`tap-plan-corner.test'.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: remove now-passing test from XFAIL_TESTS
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove `tap-signal.test',
	which is passing since previous commit `v1.11-974-gc7fa872'.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: get name of TAP-using tests correctly
	This change fixes the names of the temporary directories used
	by the TAP-based tests (e.g., test `foo.tap' now uses `foo.dir'
	rather than `foo.tap.dir'); more importantly, this make the
	variable `$destdir' defined in `tests/defs' usable also in the
	TAP tests.
	($me): Also strip the any `.tap' suffix from the name of the
	test.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: TAP tests properly decide when to remove tempdirs
	Before this change, the TAP tests in the Automake testsuite were
	removing the temporary test directory even when they failed or
	were skipped, thus making debugging more difficult.
	* tests/tap-functions.sh (incr_tap_count): Removed, superseded
	by ...
	(incr_): ... this function, which can increment the value of any
	variable passed to it.
	(result_):  Updated to use `incr_' instead of the now-removed
	`incr_tap_count_'.  Keep count of failures, xfailures, xpasses,
	and skips, using ...
	($tap_skip_count_, $tap_bad_count, _$tap_xfail_count_): ...
	these new variables.
	* tests/defs (trap): Try to use their values to decide whether
	the temporary directory being used by the test script should be
	removed or not.  Other code reorganizations.  And move the code
	for the removal of the temporary directory out to ...
	(rm_rf_): ... this new subroutine.
	(Main code): Use that instead of duplicating the code.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: improve and refactor our custom TAP shell library
	This change is mostly done in preparation for the next one.

	(result_): ... this function, which has been greatly extended and
	improved in various ways.
	(ok_, not_ok_, skip_, xfail_, xpass_): Adjust.
	Adjust comments.  Remove an extra empty line.
	* tests/instspc.tap: Use the new improved interface of `result_'.
	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: Likewise.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: update "user interface" description in tests/README
	* tests/README (Subsection "Interpretation"): Mention the "ERROR"
	outcome.
	(Subsection "Getting details from failures"): Don't tell that the
	test scripts can be run directly, this is not 100% true; anymore;
	instead ...
	(Subsection "About the tests"): ... use this new subsection to
	explain how to run the tests (either simple or TAP-based) by hand.
	(Subsection "Supported shells"): Extend to refer to TAP tests too.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: TAP tests can have early plan now
	* tests/defs: When using TAP, allow the user to specify the number
	of tests through the `$planned' variable.
	(trap): Do not print the auto-generated plan if an explicit one
	has already been printed.
	* tests/defs-static.in: Complain and bail out if the `$planned'
	variable is exported in the environment.  Reformat the code to
	facilitate future additions.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Neutralize `$planned'.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update.
	* tests/ac-output-old.tap: Give an explicit TAP plan, by defining

	* tests/automake-cmdline.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/tap-bad-prog.tap: Likewise.
	* tests/instspc.tap: Likewise, and related adjustments.

	plan, and tell why.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: run autogenerated tests with $(LOG_COMPILER) too
	This change enhances consistency in the testsuite.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Some cosmetic reordering, to keep the
	definition of FOO_LOG_COMPILER near to the place where `.foo'
	is added to $(TEST_EXTENSIONS).
	(PTEST_LOG_COMPILER): Run `$(srcdir)/parallel-tests.sh' with
	`$(LOG_COMPILER)', not with `$(SHELL)'.
	(SHTST_LOG_COMPILER): Likewise.

2011-08-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: run TAP and "plain" tests with the same $(LOG_COMPILER)
	With this change, it will be easier to override, at make time, the
	shell used to run the tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am (LOG_COMPILER): Define to `$(SHELL)'.
	(TEST_LOG_COMPILER): Re-define to `$(LOG_COMPILER)'.
	(TAP_LOG_COMPILER): Likewise.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: run TAP-based tests explicitly with $(SHELL)
	* tests/Makefile.am (TAP_LOG_COMPILER): Define to `$(SHELL)'.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap driver: handle signals received by the tests being run
	* lib/tap-driver (get_test_exit_message): Also deal with signals,
	by using the `wait' method of the TAP::Parser object instead of
	the `exit' method.  This required the use of the standard perl
	module `POSIX'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Use TAP with the Automake test harness):
	Document that `--ignore-exit' has effect also on terminating
	signals.  Add a "synchronizing" comment that references the tests
	'tap-exit.test' and 'tap-signal.test'.
	* tests/tap-signal.test: Extend and adjust.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap driver: a preparatory refactoring (1)
	* lib/tap-driver (finish): Do not flush the TAP stream nor
	fetch the exit status of the TAP producer if running with
	the `--ignore-exit' option.  Obviously, don't try to write
	such exit status in the test log anymore.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	cosmetics: typofix in the name of a function in the TAP driver
	* lib/tap-driver (testuite_error): Renamed ...
	(testsuite_error): ... to this, and minor related reformatting.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: scripts with a SKIP plan but with exit status != 0 must error
	This change has been motivated by Automake's own testsuite.  Some
	TAP tests there were erroring out (due to unexpected, unhandled
	failures) before having encountered TAP result, so that the
	simple-minded shell library implementing TAP generation ended up
	printing a "1..0" trailing test plan; this caused the script to be
	reported as a SKIP rather than an ERROR -- a nasty false negative.
	* lib/tap-driver: Add prototypes for each subroutine, to free up
	the order in which they can be defined and called.
	(main): Move the code checking for a bad exit status of the TAP
	producer ...
	(finish): ... here, and flush the TAP stream to ensure that the
	parser always obtains the producer's exit status.
	* tests/tap-skip-whole-badexit.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tap_with_common_setup_tests): Add it.

2011-08-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: fix whitespace munging of diagnostic messages
	* lib/tap-driver (extract_tap_comment): Pass the `g' flag to the

	* tests/instspc.tap (is_in_list): New helper subroutine.
	(expected_to_fail): Re-implement using it.
	(define_problematic_string): Likewise.  Also, rename the special
	arguments `build-fail' and 'install-fail' to respectively
	`builddir-fail' and `destdir-fail', and other related changes.

	* tests/depmod-tests.sh: Delete this complex and multifarious
	script, moving all it checks it used to perform into ...
	* tests/depmod.tap: ... this TAP-based test script.  And extend
	it quite a bit, since the new form of the test was papering over

	testsuite: do fd redirections with $(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT)
	* tests/Makefile.am: The redirections of file descriptors needed
	by our test scripts is now done using the $(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT)
	variable (the new blessed way since commit `v1.11-906-gb9e9d54'),
	not using an hack involving $(AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT).  This has
	the further benefit of allowing the use of $(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT)
	again on part of the users.
	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove redirection of
	file descriptors.
	(AM_TESTS_FD_REDIRECT): Redirect file descriptor 9 to original

2011-08-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: use custom TAP diagnostic in our own tests
	This change allow us to easily and transparently avoid spurious
	TAP diagnostic in our own testsuite, with the help of the new
	`--diagnostic-string' option of our TAP test driver.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TAP_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS): Also pass option
	`--diagnostic-string' with value `#%#' (necessarily obtained
	through some shell indirections).

	tap: new option to change the string designating TAP diagnostic
	Here we introduce a new option `--diagnostic-string' in our TAP
	test driver, that allows the user to specify which string should
	denote the beginning of a TAP diagnostic line.  This change is
	not gratuitous, nor result if over-engineering: it is motivated
	by real issues that have emerged during the use of TAP in the
	Automake's own testsuite (see the commit `v1.11-1082-g9b967c2'
	"testsuite: yet more use of TAP, and related extensions").
	* doc/automake.texi (Use TAP with Automake test harness): Document
	the new option.
	(Incompatibilities with other TAP parsers and drivers): Report it

	check: update comments to reflect recent heavy changes

	be more consistent with the `tap-driver' script.
	Improve a couple of comments.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Don't define anymore the now-obsolete
	make macro `$(TEST_LOGS_TMP)', nor add it to the list of files to
	be removed upon "make mostlyclean".
	* lib/am/check.am ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): New shell function `f_ok',
	tells whether a path refers to an existing, regular, readable file.
	Use it throughout.
	(recheck): Be safer w.r.t. make implementation that run recipes
	with `errexit' shell flag active.

2011-08-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	docs: some fixlets in documentation on testsuites support

	Slightly extend and clarify introductory sentence.

2011-08-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test harness: be aware of more metadata, simplify test drivers
	* lib/am/check.am ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)):  When producing the
	global test log, take into account the new metadata field

	drivers.
	(am_rst_section): Re-introduce this variable, as removed in
	commit `v1.11-870-ga27c9c4'.
	* lib/test-driver, lib/tap-driver: Write the global test result
	as metadata in the `.trs' file, not as (part of) a formatted RST

	testsuite: scaffolding to allow use of TAP in our own tests
	Now that Automake has initial support for the TAP test protocol,
	we can start "eating our own dog food" and rewrite some tests to
	use TAP; this should allow for better granularity, especially in
	the control of skips and expected failures.  With this change, we
	set up the initial scaffolding required by the planned TAP tests,
	and convert few older tests to use TAP, mostly in order to verify
	that there are no obvious errors.  The tests in our testsuite that
	use the TAP protocol will be marked by the new `.tap' extension.
	* tests/plain-functions.sh: New file containing definition of
	helper shell functions used by the "protocol-less" tests of the
	Automake testsuite.
	* tests/tap-functions.sh:  New file containing definition of
	helper shell functions used by the TAP-producing tests of the
	Automake testsuite.
	* tests/defs: Remove definitions of some functions that are
	now defined in `plain-functions.sh'.  Instead, source one of
	`plain-functions.sh' or `tap-functions.sh', depending on whether
	`$use_tap' is set to "no" or "yes".
	(exit trap): Call `late_plan_' if `$use_tap' is true.  Also,
	unset shell traces before issuing the latest commands, to avoid
	confusing the tap driver with spurious output.
	* tests/defs-static.in ($use_tap): New variable, by default set
	to "yes" if the calling test script has a `.tap' suffix, and to
	"no" otherwise.  The individual scripts can override it though.
	In code sanity-checking the environment, verify that `$use_tap'
	is not exported.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update, and small related
	reformatting.
	* tests/self-check-tap.test: New very minimal self test.
	* tests/acoutbs.test, tests/acoutbs2.test, tests/acoutnoq.test,

	Removed, merged into ...
	* tests/ac-output-old.tap: ... this new test, that uses TAP.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TAP_LOG_DRIVER): Define to invoke our own
	`tap-driver' script.
	(TAP_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS): Define to `--merge', so that the stdout
	and stderr of the test scripts remains synced.
	(TEST_EXTENSIONS): Define, to add the `.tap' suffix; also list
	the `.test' suffix explicitly.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute the new files `plain-functions.sh' and

	(AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Ensure that `use_tap' is not exported in

	test harness: use new `.trs' files to hold test metadata
	With this change, the test harness will keep test metadata in
	dedicated `.trs' files, instead of having them embedded into the
	`.log' files.  This allows for easier forward-compatibility and
	extension of test metadata, and for more flexibility in the
	format of the `.log' files.  Note that this change makes the
	`:end-metadata:' field obsolete.
	* doc/automake.texi (Parallel Test Harness, Log files generation
	and test results recording): Document the new APIs and behaviour;
	some related minor rewordings and fixlets.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): When bringing in the content of
	`check2.am', substitute %BASE% with the basename of the `.log'
	file being created by a rule.  Add the generated `.trs' files
	to the list of files to be cleaned by "make mostlyclean".
	* lib/am/check.am (am__test_driver_flags): Rename ...

	`--test-name' and `--log-file' from it: they are now define in
	the proper rules in `check2.am'.
	(am__TEST_BASES): New internal variable, holding the names of
	the tests, with any registered extension removed.
	(am__stealth_MAKE): New internal variable, can be used instead of
	$(MAKE) in recipes requiring a recursive call to make, but which
	are not intended to be executed by "make -n".
	(.log.trs): New suffix rule, to recover from deletion of `.trs'
	files.
	($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Almost completely rewritten to follow the
	new API of "test logs in `.log' files, test metadata in `.trs'
	files".  It goes to some length to work correctly in face of
	unreadable or missing `.log' and `.trs' files, and to error out
	with proper error messages when this is not possible.
	[%?PARALLEL_TESTS%] (check-TESTS): Also remove relevant "stale"
	`.trs' files (in addition to `.log files) before remaking the
	$(TEST_SUITE_LOG).
	(recheck, recheck-html): Look for the `:recheck:' field in the
	`.trs' files, not in the `.log' files.
	* lib/am/check2.am (?GENERIC?%EXT%.log, ?!GENERIC?%OBJ%): Adjust
	the call to the test driver, in particularly passing the new

	(finish): Write metadata for the test run to `$trs_file' rather
	then to `$log_file', through the use of ...
	(write_test_results): ... this new function.

	(Option parsing): Handle the `--trs-file' option, through the

	test harness: allow more metadata in log files
	This change reworks and improves the parallel test harness to use
	more specialized reStructuredText fields in the log files (instead
	of relying on specially-placed of "magic lines" and more indirect
	semantical formatting); the new fields are the following:
	 - ":recheck:": tell whether the associated test will have to be
	   re-run by "make recheck";
	 - ":copy-in-global-log:": tell whether the content of the log
	   file should be copied in the "global log" `test-suite.log';
	 - ":end-metadata:", which inhibits the scanning of the rest of
	   the log file (for what concerns test metadata).
	Also, the special `:test-result:' value "END" has been removed,
	superseded by the new `:end-metadata:' field.
	* doc/automake.texi (Log files generation and test results
	recording): Document the new API and semantics.  Remove or fix
	some obsolete comments.
	* lib/am/check.am ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG), recheck, recheck-html):

	testsuite: fix a spurious failure with non-bash shells
	* tests/tap-fancy2.test: Remove an unportable use of backslashes
	with the `echo' builtin, which was causing some shells (among them
	bash and Debian /bin/ksh) to print a `\\' string, while other
	shells (among them zsh, dash, and Solaris /bin/sh and /bin/ksh)
	were unexpectedly printing a single `\' character.  Since we are
	at it, add a sanity check to ensure that this issue does not
	resurface.

2011-07-27  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: fix spurious failures with Solaris /bin/sh
	* tests/tap-more.test: Use `echo > file', not `: > file', to
	create empty files in the "for" loops; this is required since,
	as documented in the autoconf manual, Solaris 10 /bin/sh
	"optimizes" away the `:' command after the first iteration,
	even if it is redirected.
	* tests/test-driver-custom-multitest-recheck2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/tap-numeric-description.test: Partial rewrite to avoid
	using positional parameters from the 10th onward, which are
	unportable to Solaris /bin/sh (using `${10}' causes the shell
	to die with "bad substitution").

	simple tests: support developer-defined fd redirections
	Motivated by coreutils bug#8846, and related discussions:

	 <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2011-06/msg00002.html>
	In those threads it has been shown how problematic it can be to do
	portable file descriptor redirections in the testsuite when using
	the Automake testsuite harness.  This change should remedy to that
	situation.
	* lib/am/check2.am (?GENERIC?%EXT%$(EXEEXT).log,

	* tests/parallel-tests-am_tests_environment.test: Remove checks
	about the use of redirections in AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT: they would
	check deprecated (if not undefined) behaviour now.  Strengthen a
	couple of still valid checks, to keep the test more in sync with
	the documentation.  Improve debugging information.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

	(Script-based Testsuites, Serial Test Harness, Parallel Test
	Harness): ... these new subsection.
	(DejaGnu Tests): Minor adjustments.
	Other related typofixes and rewordings throughout the manual;
	in particular, avoid to use the term "test driver" for three

2011-07-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tap: some preparatory refactoring (1)
	This refactoring is aimed at simplifying the introduction of
	colored console output for the TAP driver.
	* lib/tap-driver (console_output): Now accept two arguments, the

	parallel-tests: simplify testsuite summary
	Prefer a more deterministic, "tabular" format for the testsuite
	summary, always listing the numbers of passed, failed, xfailed,
	xpassed, skipped and errored tests, even when these numbers are

2011-07-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: make parsing of test results safer
	The new code for parsing the testsuite-generated `.log' files,
	as introduced in commit `v1.11-872-gc96b881', considers each
	`:test-result:' field anywhere in a `.log' file as a declaration
	of a test result, and accounts for it as such in the testsuite
	summary.  Unfortunately this could easily cause spurious test
	failures being reported in the testsuite summary.  This happened
	in practice with the Automake's own testsuite; for example:
	  $ make check TESTS='check12-p.test'; echo exit: $?
	  ...
	  PASS: check12-p.test
	  =====================================
	  4 of 5 tests failed
	  See tests/test-suite.log
	  Please report to bug-automake@gnu.org
	  =====================================
	  make[2]: *** [test-suite.log] Error 1
	  make: *** [check-am] Error 2
	  exit: 2
	This change introduces a new special `:test-result:' "END", that,
	when seen, prevents the rest of the log file from being parsed.

	<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2011-06/msg00199.html>

	parallel-tests: allow each test to have multiple results
	With this change, we improve the code creating the `test-suite.log'
	global log and the console testsuite summary to make it	able to
	grasp multiple results per test script.  This is required in order
	to introduce the planned support for test protocols, like TAP and
	SubUnit, which can indeed run multiple tests per test script, each
	with its individual result.
	The implementation makes use of a custom reStructuredText field

	parallel-tests: allow custom driver scripts
	Allow suffix-based definition of custom "driver script" for the
	test scripts.  These driver scripts will be responsible of
	launching the tests (or their corresponding $(LOG_COMPILER), if
	they have an associated one), interpreting and displaying the
	test results, and writing the `.log' files.
	This new API should allow easy and flexible use of different

	to implement TAP and SubUnit harnesses.
	Note that no new documentation is added by this change; that is
	be left for follow-up changes.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Define default for $(LOG_DRIVER),
	and, for any registered test extension `<ext>', define defaults
	for $(<ext>_LOG_DRIVER).  Substitute %DRIVER% using these new

	parallel-tests: add auxiliary script 'test-driver', refactor
	This refactoring should cause no API of functionality change,
	and is meant only to simplify the future implementation of TAP
	and SubUnit testsuite drivers.  More precisely, our roadmap is
	to move most of the "testsuite driving" features out of the
	Automake-generated Makefiles, and into external scripts with
	well-defined interfaces.  This will allow the user to define
	its own personalized testsuite drivers, and will also offer us
	a framework upon which to implement our new TAP and SubUnit
	drivers, all in a very unobtrusive way and retaining an high
	degree of code reuse and backward-compatibility.
	* lib/test-driver: New auxiliary script.
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist_SCRIPT_DATA): Add it.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Require the new auxiliary script
	`test-driver', and define a new internal makefile variable
	`$(am__test_driver)', used to call it.  Perform new substitution
	on `DRIVER' when processing the `check2.am' file.
	* lib/check.am (am__tty_colors): Define new shell variable
	`$am__color_tests'.
	(am__rst_section): Removed, its role taken over by the new
	`test-driver' script.
	(am__test_driver_flags): New variable, contains the command
	line options passed to `test-driver'.
	(am__check_pre): Do not deal with temporary files and exit
	traps anymore, as the `test-driver' script takes care of that
	now.  Define shell variable `$am__enable_hard_errors', used by
	`$(am__test_driver_flags)'.  Reorder so that we don't need to
	save and restore the value of the `TERM' environment variable
	anymore.
	Other related adjustments.
	(am__check_post): Remove, as its role has been completely taken
	over by the `test-driver' script.
	* am/check2.am (?GENERIC?%EXT%$(EXEEXT).log, ?GENERIC?%EXT%.log,
	?!GENERIC?%OBJ%): Call the test script through the Automake
	substituted `%DRIVER%', and honor the command-line options
	in `$(am__test_driver_flags)'.  Do not call the obsoleted
	`$(am__check_post)' anymore.
	* doc/automake.texi (Auxiliary Programs): Mention the new
	`test-driver' script.
	(Optional): Mention `test-driver' in AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR.
	Since we are at it, break the list of auxiliary scripts by
	placing one per line, to simplify potential future additions

	test defs: fix ksh-related portability bug in warning messages
	Running "make check" normally prints a diagnostic to the outermost
	stderr (usually a tty) to explain why a test is skipped, thus
	giving better and faster feedback to the user.  It used to do
	so by redirecting file descriptor 9 to stderr (via "exec 9>&2")
	before invoking the test scripts, which then would write any skip
	explanation to file descriptor 9 via the `skip_' function defined
	in `tests/defs'.
	However, various Korn Shells (at least Solaris 10's /bin/ksh and
	Debian GNU/Linux's /bin/ksh) and the HP-UX's /bin/sh close open
	file descriptors > 2 upon an `exec' system call; thus the effects
	of "exec 9>&2" are cancelled upon fork-and-exec, so we would get
	a "Bad file number" diagnostic and no skip explanation with those
	shells.
	The present change remedies this situation.
	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Redirect more portably,
	via a trailing "9>&2", rather than the prior "exec 9>&2; ...".  Add
	explanatory comments.
	* tests/defs (stderr_fileno_): Update the advice in comments.

	tests: remove 'test_prefer_config_shell' from the environment
	Since commit `v1.11-910-g7df1a9b', the once user-overridable
	variable `$test_prefer_config_shell' has become an internal
	detail, and the test scripts now complain and bail out if it is
	set in the environment.
	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Unset the variable
	`test_prefer_config_shell' if it is set in the environment.

2011-06-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: autogenerate list of wrapped tests for `lib/' shell scripts
	* tests/gen-config-shell-tests: New script, generates distributed
	makefile snippet `tests/config-shell-tests.am' to list all tests
	that use the `get_shell_script' function, with names mangled to
	use suffix `-w.shtst', in ...
	* tests/Makefile.am (config_shell_tests): ... this macro, whose
	definition has been consequently removed from Makefile.am.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute the new script.
	($(srcdir)/config-shell-tests.am): Generate using the new script.
	(include): Include the `config-shell-tests.am' fragment.
	* bootstrap: Invoke `tests/gen-config-shell-tests' to generate
	`tests/config-shell-tests.am'.
	* tests/.gitignore: Ignore `config-shell-tests.am'.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Fixlet in heading comments.

2011-06-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: test mdate-sh with /bin/sh too
	* tests/mdate5.test: Fetch the `mdate-sh' script using the
	`get_shell_script' function, and run it directly instead of
	using `$SHELL'.
	* tests/mdate6.test: Likewise.  Since we are at it, make checks
	on the `mdate-sh' output stricter, remove now unneeded calls to
	aclocal and automake and creation/extension of `configure.in',
	`Makefile.am' and `textutils.tex' files, and add a trailing `:'
	command.
	* tests/Makefile.am (config_shell_tests): Add `mdate5-w.shtst'
	and `mdate6-w.shtst'.

2011-06-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: extend tests on `--add-missing' and `--copy' a bit
	* tests/add-missing.test: Fix typo in heading comments.  Try with
	another testcase that install many (but not all) the auxiliary
	scripts at once, and uses non-standard (but valid and documented)
	setups (e.g., defining YACC in Makefile.am instead of calling
	AC_PROG_YACC from configure.in).
	* tests/copy.test: Reference `add-missing.test' in heading
	comments.  Try few more test scenarios.

2011-06-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: few fixlets and improvements
	* tests/cond31.test ($required): Remove `cc', it's not really
	needed.
	* tests/confh.test: Call autoheader too.  The lack of this call
	wasn't causing spurious failures because the automatic remake
	rules were somehow invoking it on our behalf (at make time).
	* tests/fn99subdir.test: Use $subdirname throughout, instead of
	${subdirname}, for consistency with the rest of the testsuite.
	Avoid an unnecessary subshell, which could also cause spurious
	passes, being guarded by a trailing `|| Exit 1', which neutralize
	the `errexit' flag.  Remove an unnecessary `|| Exit 1' guard.
	* tests/insh2.test: Rewrite to avoid hackish Makefile.in munging,
	and to also run configure and make.

2011-06-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: don't hard-code test name in txinfo21.test
	* tests/txinfo21.test: Use `$me' instead of hard-coding the
	current testcase name "txinfo21".  Add a trailing `:' command
	since we are at it.

2011-06-10  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: new test dedicated to `--add-missing' and `--copy'

	Suggested by Peter Rosin.

2011-06-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: use 'fatal_' and 'framework_failure_' for hard errors
	* tests/defs (require_xsi): Use `fatal_', not `framework_failure',
	to report an invalid usage.
	* tests/remake-gnulib-remove-header.test: Prefer using `fatal_'
	with a proper error message over a direct call to `Exit 99'.

	self tests: check new 'fatal_' function
	* tests/self-check-exit.test: Also check the new 'fatal_'
	function.

2011-06-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: new function 'fatal_', for hard errors
	Before this patch, the only way offered by tests/defs to
	properly signal a hard error was the `framework_failure_'
	function.  But the error message issued by that function,
	as its name would suggest, refers to a set-up failure in the
	testsuite, while hard errors can obviously also be due to
	other reasons.  The best way to fix this inconsistency is to
	introduce a new function with a more general error message.
	Inspired by a recent similar change to Gnulib's tests/init.sh.
	* tests/defs (fatal_): New function.
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Suggest the use of `fatal_', not of `framework_failure_', for
	generic hard errors.  The latter should be reserved for "real"
	set-up failures.

	* NEWS: Update.

2011-06-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	py-compile: normalize error and help messages
	* lib/py-compile: Now error messages do not begin with a capital
	letter, nor end with a period, as per GNU standards.  Prepend the
	error messages with the name of the script, not with its path.
	When an invalid usage is recognized, always display the customary
	message "Try `py-compile --help' ..." on a line of its own.
	($me): New variable, containing the name of the
	program, i.e., `py-compile'.  Use it throughout.
	(usage_error): New function, used to display error messages about
	invalid usage.
	* tests/py-compile-usage.test: Extend and tighten accordingly.

	(am__py_compile): New variable, to reduce code duplication.


2011-06-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: `lib/' shell scripts transparently tested also with $SHELL
	With the previous commit, the user could prefer the use of $SHELL
	over /bin/sh in some tests checking the Automake-provided shell
	scripts by manually exporting `test_prefer_config_shell' to "yes"
	in the environment.  With this commit, we ensure that such tests
	*always* and *transparently* run using both $SHELL and /bin/sh
	to execute the checked scripts.  The `test_prefer_config_shell'
	variable becomes an internal detail, and is no more meant to be
	manually defined or overridden.
	* tests/defs-static.in: Check that `test_prefer_config_shell' is
	not exported in the environment.  Error out if this is the case.
	* tests/config-shell-tests.sh: New file, driver script to run
	checks on the shell scripts in `lib/' using the $SHELL determined
	at configure time instead of the default system shell /bin/sh.
	* Makefile.am (TESTS_EXTENSIONS): Add `.shtst'.
	(SHTST_LOG_COMPILER): Define, it calls `config-shell-tests.sh'.
	(config_shell_tests): Define to a list of tests that wraps other
	`*.test' tests using `config-shell-tests.sh'.
	($(config_shell_tests)): Dummy dependency declaration required
	in order to have make actually produce expected log files from
	the `.shtst.log' suffix rule.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute `config-shell-tests.sh'.
	(TESTS): Add `$(config_shell_tests)'.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update, by checking that
	`test_prefer_config_shell' isn't exported in the environment.

2011-06-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: can use also $SHELL to check shell scripts from `lib/'
	* tests/ar-lib.test: If the variable `$test_prefer_config_shell'
	is set to "yes", run the script under test with configure-time
	determined $SHELL, rather than with /bin/sh.
	The `$test_prefer_config_shell' variable defaults to empty, but

	check that $SHELL, not /bin/sh, supports XSI constructs, as we
	expect the test will use $SHELL and not /bin/sh to run the
	script being tested.

2011-06-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests defs: better requirements for XSI shells
	This change avoids potential spurious failures with tests using
	the requirement 'xsi-shell' to mean that they want */bin/sh* (not
	$SHELL) to be XSI-conforming.  This idiom used to work before
	commit `v1.11-874-g1321be7' (as back then the test scripts were
	unconditionally run with /bin/sh), but has become inconsistent
	now that the test scripts re-execute themselves with configure
	determined $SHELL.
	The described spurious failures have already occurred in practice,
	for examples on Solaris systems which also had GNU Bash installed.
	From a suggestion by Peter Rosin.  See discussion at:
	<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2011-06/msg00016.html>
	* tests/defs (xsi-shell): Now check that $SHELL, rather than the
	shell currently running the test script, is an XSI shell.
	(xsi-bin-sh): New requirement, checking that /bin/sh (which can
	differ from $SHELL) is an XSI shell.
	(xsi-lib-shell): New requirement, checking that the shell that
	should be used to test the Automake-provided scripts from `lib/'
	is an XSI shell.  For the moment, this is just an alias for
	`xsi-bin-sh'.
	(require_xsi): New subroutine, used to factor out code common to
	the requirements above.
	($xsi_shell_code): New variable, contains shell code supposed to
	work only with XSI shells.  Used by the new subroutine above.
	* tests/ar-lib.test ($required): Require 'xsi-lib-shell' instead
	of 'xsi-shell', since the script we test here is run with /bin/sh,
	not with $SHELL.
	* tests/compile3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/compile6.test: Likewise.

2011-06-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix typo-related error in auxdir2.test
	* tests/auxdir2.test (configure.in):  Close m4 quoting in the
	argument to AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR.  Without this, aclocal fails with
	"ERROR: end of file in string".  This problem hasn't been exposed
	by the testsuite before because this test is in XFAIL_TESTS, so
	its failure went unnoticed, even if it was due to a wrong cause.
	Bug introduced in commit v1.11-249-g49ac3de.

2011-06-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	self tests: check that `$me' can be overridden
	* tests/self-check-me.test: Check that `$me' can be overridden
	before sourcing ./defs, with or without sourcing ./defs-static
	beforehand, and that this override is honored.  Update heading
	comments.

2011-06-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	self tests: fix another spurious failure
	Our ad-hoc usage of `tests/defs' in the testsuite's self tests
	stopped working properly when we made the test scripts re-execute
	themselves with the configure-time $SHELL.  Fix this.
	Fixes a regression introduced by commit 'v1.11-874-g1321be7'.
	* tests/self-check-exit.test: Export `AM_TESTS_REEXEC' to "no"
	before running the self tests.  This fixes a spurious failure
	present only when the test was run by hand.

2011-06-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	silent-rules tests: fix spurious failures with Sun Studio C++
	* tests/silentcxx.test: The C++ compiler from Sun Studio is named
	`CC'.  Account for this in our grepping checks on the make output.
	Since we are at it, throw in a couple of improvements to comments
	and formatting.
	* tests/silent-many-generic.test: The C++ compiler from Sun Studio
	is named `CC', and this can cause spurious failures in our grepping
	of the make output.  Work around this by using a wrapper script
	around the C++ compiler (generated on the fly), since filtering the
	make output proved to be too fragile.

2011-06-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure in backcompat2.test on NetBSD
	* tests/backcompat2.test: Add trailing `:' in the body of a `for'
	loop, in case the last command there might have an exit status
	different 0.  This work around `set -e' issues in some BSD shells,
	e.g., NetBSD /bin/ksh.

2011-06-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure in autohdr3.test
	* tests/autohder3.test (Makefile.am): Let `test' depend on `all',

	Remove now useless call to `$MAKE' when non-GNU make is in use.
	Failure introduced by commit `v1.11-895-g5e62b96'.

2011-06-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure of cond29.test on NetBSD
	* tests/cond29.test: Skip if we cannot safely limit the maximal

	to `automake'.
	(sc_diff_aclocal_in_aclocal): New maintainer check, similar to
	the above, and checking that only 10 lines are changed from
	`aclocal.in' to `aclocal'.
	(syntax_check_rules): Update.
	(sc_tests_Exit_not_exit): Exempt self tests `self-check-*.test'
	from this check, as they can legitimately use the bare `exit'
	builtin in various places.
	* doc/automake.texi (Python): Remove stray `@' from the end of
	a line.  Typo introduced in commit `v1.11-312-g5bf7af6'.
	* tests/depcomp8a.test: Pass DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS to make

	remake: behave better with non-GNU make in subdirectories
	Currently, with every decent make program, it is possible to
	rebuild out-of-date autotools-generated files with a simple

	tests: prefer ulimit over timeout in test on a memory-hogging bug
	* tests/cond29.test: Use 'ulimit' instead of 'timeout' to ensure
	that automake does not uses up too much resources.  This is really
	and improvement because the bug tested by this script wasn't just
	a "it hangs" or "it runs too slow" bug, but rather a memory-hogging
	bug (due to combinatorial explosion when many Automake conditionals
	had to be handled) which could easily crash the whole system, which
	is unacceptable.  The requirement of a proper and working 'ulimit'
	builtin might cause the test to be skipped on more systems, but
	that shouldn't be a problem since the bug isn't about a portability
	issue, but is rather an automake internal implementation problem.
	I've verified that the test as updated by this patch still passes
	with automake 1.8.5, automake 1.10.2, and obviously the development
	version of automake, and that it fails with automake 1.7.9.

	testsuite: avoid generating `*-p.test' tests, use a wrapper script
	The generated `*-p.test' tests had already become just thin layers
	around the corresponding test scripts.  This change makes the final
	step, converting to the use of a generic wrapper script and thus
	avoiding the extra test generation (similarly to what is done for
	the `*.instspc' and `*.depmod' tests).
	* tests/parallel-tests.sh: New file, driver script to run checks
	the on the `parallel-tests' semantics by wrapping tests that use
	the generic "Simple Tests" driver.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Update, mostly to reflect the new
	`.ptest' extensions used for tests in $(parallel_tests).
	* Makefile.am (TESTS_EXTENSIONS): Add `.ptest'.
	(PTEST_LOG_COMPILER): Define, it calls `parallel-tests.sh'.
	($(parallel_tests)): Do not really generate `*-p.test' tests
	anymore; this is now just a dummy dependency declaration required
	in order to have make actually produce expected log files from
	the `.ptest.log' suffix rule.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute `parallel-tests.sh'.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Don't remove the `$(parallel_tests)', it
	is not necessary anymore.
	(generated_tests): Variable definition removed.
	(TESTS): Update, by listing `$(parallel_tests)' directly instead
	of `$(generated_tests)'
	(expected_list_of_tests): Remove `$(generated_tests)'.
	(maintainer-check-list-of-tests): No need to explicitly depend on
	`$(expected_list_of_tests)' anymore.

	automake, aclocal: honour configure-time AUTOCONF and AUTOM4TE
	Currently, the Automake's own configure script allow definition
	of AUTOCONF and AUTOM4TE, expected to point respectively to an
	autoconf and autom4te programs.  But while these definitions are
	honoured in the Automake's build systems and test suite, they
	were *not* honoured in the generated `automake' and `aclocal'
	scripts.  This behaviour, apart from being wrong in that it does
	not allow the user enough freedom in choosing his tools, also
	caused inconsistencies in the test suite, brining to spurious
	failures.
	Problem reported by Graham Reitz on the automake list; see thread:
	<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-05/msg00022.html>
	* automake.in ($traces): Use `@am_AUTOCONF', not simply `autoconf'.

	build: the user can override AUTOM4TE, AUTORECONF and AUTOUPDATE too
	Our build system allows the user to override AUTOCONF and AUTOHEADER
	at configure time, and honours these overrides in our testsuite.

	This change fixes that inconsistency.
	* configure.ac (am_AUTOM4TE, am_AUTOUPDATE, am_AUTORECONF): New
	AC_SUBSTitutions.  Update comments.

	tests/README: fix example about `make -e' usage
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"): When
	some variable is never initialized in the Makefile, `-e' is not
	necessary in order to override it.  DESTDIR is such a variable: we
	ensure that we do not ever initialize it.  And as such, it is quite
	portable to use:
	  $ make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install
	and in fact, quite widely used.
	So our example about when `make -e' is required, which references
	the `DESTDIR' variable, is poorly chosen, if not downright wrong.
	Rewrite it to use `prefix' as the overridden variable instead.

	tests: tweak and improve tests on Automake conditionals
	The "avoid the requirement of a working compiler" we refer about

	The "cosmetic changes" we refer about below consists in, e.g.,
	adding a trailing `:' command to a script, using proper m4 quoting
	in `configure.in' files, adding commands that offer more debugging

	lex tests: avoid spurious failures when LEXLIB isn't found
	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a `yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with `-ll' and `-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.
	This behaviour might be (partly) intended; the Autoconf manual
	reads:
	 ``You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	   both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source
	   it produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability,
	   however, you must either provide a function `yywrap' or, if
	   you don't use it (e.g., your scanner has no `#include'-like
	   feature), simply include a `%noyywrap' statement in the
	   scanner's source.''
	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of the
	Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing `yywrap' (this happens for example in	Linux->MinGW cross
	compilations).  But at this point is clear that a proper workaround
	is to simply provide a fall-back implementation of `yywrap' in our
	lexers.

	testsuite: allow user to ask for stricter skip semantics
	Given how the Automake testsuite is currently structured, if a
	command in a test script fails with status `77', the global test
	outcome is considered a SKIP, because the value of `77' for `$?'
	is passed to the exit trap.  Indeed, this happens in practice, as
	an autoconf-generated configure script can exit with status `77'
	if it fails to find, e.g., a required compiler.
	While this behaviour is quite useful for avoiding spurious test
	failures in the wild, it can also sometimes prevent the Automake
	developers to easily see and declare the requirements of their
	tests.
	This change introduces a new variable `am_explicit_skips', meant to
	be user-overridable, and which, when set to a "true" value (i.e.,
	`yes' or `1'), require a direct call to `Exit 77' in order to make
	the test outcome be considered a SKIP.
	* tests/defs.in ($am__test_skipped): New variable, initialized
	to `no'.
	(Exit): Set `$am__test_skipped' to `yes' if passed an exit status
	of 77.
	(trap '...' 0): When `$am_explicit_skips' is set to a "true" value,
	reset an exit status of `77' to `78' if $am__test_skipped is not
	set to `yes'.
	* tests/self-check-exit.test: Adjust: unset `am_explicit_skips'.
	* tests/self-check-explicit-skips.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

	testsuite: user can force skipping of compiler-requiring tests
	* tests/defs (cc, c++, fortran, fortran77): Skip the test if
	the relevant compiler is disabled by having the corresponding
	variable (CC, CXX, FC and F77, respectively) set to "false".
	(yacc): For consistency, skip the test when the YACC variable
	is set to "false", not when it's set to "no".  Since we are at
	it, fix the skip message to be shorter and more consistent.

	* tests/defs (cross_compiling): Consider cross-compilation mode
	active only if `$host_alias' is not empty *and* it differs from
	`$build_alias'.  This is more faithful to the way configure
	determines whether it is cross-compiling, but still allows the

	and `build_alias' at runtime.
	From a report by Ralf Wildenhues.

	testsuite: avoid re-running few tests with 'parallel-tests' option
	Some tests in our testsuite use the 'simple-tests' driver only
	marginally, or simply as a mean to conveniently check unrelated
	invariants.  It makes little sense to force these tests to also
	run with the 'parallel-tests' Automake option active, as doing so
	offers no real gain in coverage, while often causing a measurable
	overhead in execution time (for an already too-slow testsuite).

	(Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do not"):  When

	lex: "make clean" removes .c files from non-distributed .l
	Previously, while automake did *not* distribute C source and header
	files derived from non-distributed Lex sources, it still caused
	them to be removed only by "make maintainer-clean" only, and not by
	simply "make clean" or "make distclean".
	This caused "make distcheck" to fail, unless the developer put
	those generated .c files in CLEANFILES or in DISTCLEANFILES by
	hand.
	This change fixes this issue, by making non-distributed `.c' files
	generated by non-distributed Lex sources cleaned by "make clean".
	A similar problem for Yacc support had been fixed with the commit
	v1.11-263-ged2c8bc.
	* tests/automake.in (lang_lex_target_hook): Make C source files

2011-05-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	lex tests: remove erroneous check about ylwrap distribution
	* tests/lex5.test: Do not check that the ylwrap script is *not*
	distributed when there is only one lexer, as ylwrap is in fact
	expected to distributed unconditionally (at least starting from
	commit `Release-1-9-323-gc5881cc' of 19-08-2006).  Note that this
	bogus check wasn't triggering any failure because it was done at
	the wrong time (i.e. from the VPATH build directory), so that it
	could never fail anyway.
	Instead, check that ylwrap is distributed even when there is only
	one lexer.
	Since we are at it, add a couple of `ls -l' calls, to get better
	debugging info.

	Most of the new requirements that are now accepted in `$required'
	as consequence of this patch are still dummy.  They are planned

2011-05-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: increase coverage w.r.t. GNU make
	* tests/defs (GNUmake): Instead of just skipping the tests
	requiring GNU make if $MAKE is not GNU make, try to look for
	it and, if found, redefine $MAKE accordingly.  This will help
	to transparently increase coverage on non-GNU systems which
	have GNU make available in PATH.

2011-05-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: improve few inter-tests references
	* tests/acloca22.test: Improve and extend the heading comments.
	Add reference to related tests 'remake-deleted-m4-file.test' and
	'remake-renamed-m4-macro-and-file.test'.  Since we are at it,
	add trailing `:' command, and few blank lines for readability.
	* tests/remake-renamed-m4-macro-and-file.test: In the heading
	comments, add reference to the related test 'acloca22.test'.

2011-05-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure in 'color2.test'
	* tests/color2.test: If $MAKE contains command-line arguments (as
	in e.g., "make -j2"), expect's directive "spawn $env(MAKE)" fails
	spuriously, because it tries to run "$MAKE" as a single command.
	Fix this with proper uses of the TCL `eval' builtin.

2011-05-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: few more checks on automatic remake support
	* tests/remake-all-1.test: New test, check that the "all" target
	triggers rebuilt of outdated Makefiles.
	* tests/remake-all-2.test: Likewise, but for when the makefiles
	are not named `Makefile'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2011-05-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: check some remake features with non-GNU make too
	* tests/acloca14.test ($required): Drop "GNUmake".  This test
	works as-is with non-GNU make implementations.
	* tests/remake1a.test: Likewise.
	* tests/aclocal4.test ($required): Drop "GNUmake".

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: extend tests on dependency tracking with VPATH
	* tests/depmod-tests.sh: New script, fulfilling a threefold role:
	1. it is called to generate a Makefile.am snippet, containing the
	   definition of proper lists of tests;
	2. it is called to set up a directory containing some common data
	   files and autotools-generated files used by the aforementioned
	   tests (this is done for speed reasons only); and
	3. it is called to properly run those tests, one at a time.
	* tests/depcomp9.test: Delete, it's obsolete now.
	* tests/depcomp10.test: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/depmod-tests.am): Include this
	snippet, which defines ...
	(depmode_tests): ... this new macro, containing the list of the
	newly generated `*.depmod' tests.
	(TESTS_EXTENSIONS): Add `.depmod'.
	(DEPMOD_LOG_COMPILER): Define.  It calls `depmod-tests.sh', so that
	the "depmode tests" will be executed by passing that driver script
	a proper parameter.
	($(depmod_tests)): New dependency declaration (dummy, but required
	in order to have make actually produce expected log files from the
	`.depmod.log' suffix rule).
	(TESTS): Add $(depmod_tests).
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute depmod-tests.sh.
	Other minor cosmetic changes and reorderings.
	* bootstrap: Generate depmod-tests.am.
	* tests/.gitignore: Updated.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: avoid extra test generation (for `instspc' tests)
	We don't really need to generate tons and tons of wrapper test
	scripts (presently, ~ 90) just to run what is basically a single
	test (specifically, `instspc-tests.sh') with different parameters.
	In fact, the possibility of running a single driver script with
	multiple files/configurations/parameters is one of the major
	selling points of the 'parallel-tests' testsuite driver of
	automake.  So why not use ourselves more extensively the best
	features we provide?
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh: Update heading comments.  Expect
	to be executed, not sourced.  Update handling of command-line
	arguments.  Adjust to reflect the renaming of "instspc tests"
	from `instspc-*.test' to `*.instspc'.
	* tests/instspc-data.test: Update heading comments.  Execute
	driver script `instspc-tests.sh', instead of sourcing it.
	Give more informative messages in case of internal errors.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_EXTENSIONS): Define explicitly (to
	`.test' and `.instspc').
	(TESTS): Add `$(instspc_tests)'.
	(generated_tests): Remove `$(instspc_tests)'.
	(INSTSPC_LOG_COMPILER): Define.  Calls `instspc-tests.sh', so
	that the "instspc tests" will be now executed by passing that
	driver script a proper parameter.
	($(instspc_tests)): Remove, we don't need anymore to generate
	this tests.
	($(instspc_tests:.test=.log)): Remove, substituted by ...
	($(instspc_tests:.instspc=.log)): ... this.
	($(instspc_tests)): New dependency declaration (dummy, but
	required in order to have make actually produce expected log
	files from the `.instspc.log' suffix rule).
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES, generated_tests): Don't extend with
	$(instspc_tests) anymore.
	Update comments.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	build: improve the definition of the list of testcases
	* tests/Makefile.am (handwritten_tests): New variable.
	(generated_tests): Likewise.
	(TESTS): Redefine as the union of the above.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Extend using $(handwritten_tests) and
	$(generated_tests) rather than $(TESTS).
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Update accordingly, and
	make more robust.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests skips: shorter and clearer messages
	* tests/defs: Use shorter messages when giving reasons for test
	skipping; it turns out these shorter messages are also clearer.
	If more info might be useful, send them to the log file only.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix self check spurious failure with older bash versions
	* tests/self-check-cleanup.test: Add trailing `:' to the test code
	passed to $SHELL, otherwise older versions of bash (at least 2.05
	and 3.2.39) fail to correctly remove the temporary directory in
	the exit trap.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: add sanity check to 'self-check-cleanup.test'
	* tests/self-check-cleanup.test: Check that the "hacked" file
	`defs-static' used by the test differs from the "vanilla" one
	in builddir.  This also offers a little more debugging output.

2011-05-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: display reasons for skips to the console
	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Open file descriptor

2011-04-29  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: more environment sanitization
	* tests/defs: Move the checks verifying that the variables `me',
	`parallel_tests' and `required' aren't set in the environment ...
	* tests/defs-static.in: ... in here, with some optimizations to
	avoid useless forks.  Also, do the same checks for the variables
	`original_AUTOMAKE' and `original_ACLOCAL' too.
	* tests/self-check-env-sanitize.test: Update.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Unset also variables
	`original_AUTOMAKE' and `original_ACLOCAL'.

2011-04-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure (non-renamed AM_TESTS_SETUP usage)
	* tests/parallel-tests-reset-term.test: Use AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT
	instead of AM_TESTS_SETUP (which has been removed in commit

2011-04-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure in a test on TESTS (VPATH-related)
	* tests/check-tests-in-builddir.test: When not using the

	driver do not try to strip them.

2011-04-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

2011-04-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test: self check subroutines for skipping/failing of tests

2011-04-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>
	    Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test defs: new subroutines for test skipping/failing
	* tests/defs.in (Exit): Move definition of this function earlier.
	(warn_, skip_, fail_, framework_failure_): New functions, inspired
	to the homonyms in gnulib's tests/init.sh.
	($stderr_fileno_): New global variable, used by the new functions
	above.
	* tests/README: Updated.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

2011-04-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: remove redundant test `mclean.test'
	* tests/mclean.test: Remove, it's a weak grepping test completely
	superseded by the much more complete `maintclean.test'.

	The AM_TESTS_SETUP naming was not a good one after all.  It may
	be technically more correct than AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT, but the
	latter is a better one simply because it is easier to remember,
	and even if you've never heard of it and only know the semantics

	yacc: extension of headers modelled after extension of sources
	With this change, if '-d' is in *YFLAGS, a yacc input file named
	foo.y++ will cause a foo.h++ header to be generated, instead of a
	foo.h header.  Similarly for foo.ypp, foo.yxx and foo.yy.
	This way, the name of the files generated by an automake-created
	`ylwrap' invocation should be consistent with those generated by
	a `bison -o' call.
	Related to automake bug#7648 and PR automake/491.
	* lib/am/yacc.am (am__yacc_c2h): New internal variable.

	We don't want YACC and LEX defined as make variables, otherwise
	the values determined at configure time will override those from

	before this change, with the following usage:
	  $ ./configure YACC=yacc

	yacc: "make clean" removes .c and .h files from non-distributed .y
	Previously, while automake did *not* distribute C source and header
	files derived from non-distributed Yacc sources, it still caused

	maintcheck: look for problematic names of testcases
	The configure.in stub created by default by `tests/defs' obtains
	the first argument of AC_INIT from the test name, and this can
	cause some supported autoconf versions to fail with a spurious
	error if that test name contains the name of an m4 or m4sugar
	builtin or macro (e.g., `defn' or `m4_undefine').
	See for example the bug fixed by commit v1.11-287-g1325a8a.
	This change add a maintainer check that warns about test names
	which are possibly problematic in this regard.

	When the LTLIBRARIES primary was used, but $(LIBTOOL) wasn't

	suggest the use of this latter macro instead.

	with 'LT_INIT', not with 'AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.

	Helper subroutines, variables and other pieces of code defined

	* tests/self-check-is_newest.test: New test, checking the
	`is_newest' subroutine.
	* tests/self-check-me.test: New test, checking that $me gets

	* tests/self-check-sanity.test: New test, check that the sanity

2011-02-15  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: optimize `instspc-*.test' for speed
	After the split of `instspc.test' into various generated tests,
	the running time of the testsuite has noticeably increased, since
	all of these new generated tests must run aclocal, autoconf and
	automake, whereas previously they were run only once (at the
	beginning of `instspc.test').  But luckily, since the new tests
	share the same input files for the autotools, this situation can
	be easily worked around (at the expenses of a slight increase of
	complexity for the testsuite scaffolding).
	* tests/instspc-data.test: New helper test, properly calling
	the `instspc-tests.sh' script to generate input data for the
	others `instspc-*.test' tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add `instspc-data.test'.
	($(instspc_tests:.test=.log)): Depend on its log file.
	(instspc-data.log): Depend on `instspc-tests.sh'.
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh: Recognize new action `generate-data',
	and use it to create hand-written and autotools-generated static
	files shared by all the `instspc-*.test' tests.
	When sourced by the `instspc-*.test' tests, use those previously
	created files instead of recreating them from scratch.
	(unindent, create_input_data): New subroutines.
	Some other related changes and refactorings.

	since they can change quite unpredictably among different python
	installations.  Also, avoid "hyping" debugging output, thus

	turned off by default in `foreign' strictness.
	(Options): Divide into new sections "Options generalities" and
	"List of Automake options".  Fix typo (colon instead of full

	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE which wins over command line).  Also document
	interactions between options specifying strictness and those
	specifying warnings.

	More tests on warnings/strictness precedence.
	* tests/warning-groups-win-over-strictness.test: New test, similar

	Ensure that, for what concerns the options specified in
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS, explicitly-defined warnings always take
	precedence over implicit strictness-implied warnings.
	This finally fixes Automake bug#7669 a.k.a. PR/547.

	only once per set of options.
	* lib/Automake/Options.pm (process_global_option_list,

	* tests/warnings-win-over-strictness.test: Extend.

	For PR automake/547:
	Change signature of 'Automake::Options::_process_option_list()'.
	This only modifies internal details in the automake implementation,
	bearing no externally visible effect, but preparing the way for the
	final fix of Automake bug#7669 a.k.a. PR/547.
	* lib/Automake/Options.pm (_process_option_list): Accept as
	arguments a list of hash references with keys 'option' and 'where',
	where 'option' is an option as might occur in AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS or
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, and 'where' is the location where it occurred.
	(process_option_list, process_global_option_list): Updated.
	* automake.in (handle_options, scan_autoconf_traces): Update.

	Add more tests about AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.

	yacc: more tests on *YFLAGS support
	* tests/yflags-var-expand.test: New test, still xfailing.  It
	exposes automake bug#7800 -- "automake fails to honor `-d' in
	AM_YFLAGS when variable expansions are involved".
	* tests/yflags-d-false-positive.test: New test, checking that
	automake do not spuriously see `-d' in *YFLAGS when that isn't
	really there.
	* tests/yflags-force-override.test: New test, checking that
	automake can cope with definition of the YFLAGS variable in

	($distdir): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

	* tests/yacc.test: Use stricter grepping.  Add trailing `:'.
	* tests/yacc6.test: Likewise.
	* tests/yacc3.test: Likewise.  Do not create the unused file

	yacc: "make clean" removes .c and .h files from non-distributed .y
	Previously, while automake did *not* distribute C source and header
	files derived from non-distributed Yacc sources, it still caused
	them to be removed only by "make maintainer-clean" only, and not by
	simply "make clean" or "make distclean".
	This caused "make distcheck" to fail, unless the developer put
	those generated .c and .h files in CLEANFILES or in DISTCLEANFILES
	by hand.
	This change fixes this issue, by making non-distributed `.c' and
	`.h' files generated by non-distributed Yacc sources cleaned by
	"make clean".
	* tests/automake.in (lang_yacc_target_hook): Make C source and
	header files derived from non-distributed Yacc files cleaned by
	"make clean", not only by "make maintainer-clean".

2010-12-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix parallel testsuite run with Zsh.
	This change deals with a Zsh incompatibility in the handling
	of the special shell variable `$0' in sourced files; this
	incompatibility used to cause utter breakage when the
	Automake testsuite was run in parallel mode with Zsh as
	the $(TEST_LOG_COMPILER).
	For more information, please refer to the thread "Fix parallel
	testsuite run with zsh" on automake-patches, dated 2010-12-22:
	 <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2010-12/msg00135.html>
	This change works around the problems described above for Zsh 4.3
	or later, and offers better error messages (instead of random
	failures) for earlier Zsh version.
	* tests/README (Supported shells): When describing the manual
	workaround about the Zsh incompatibility in the handling of `$0',
	tell that it is now needed only with Zsh versions preceding 4.3.
	Done also some minor rewordings.
	* tests/defs-static.in ($argv0): New variable, offers a workaround
	for the Zsh incompatibility in the handling of `$0'.
	Abort if that variable cannot be correctly set (can happen only
	in older Zsh version).
	* tests/defs ($me): Define using `$argv0', not `$0'.

	distlinksbrk.test: Work around botched "make -k".
	* tests/distlinksbrk.test: Run "make" multiple times and grep
	its output each time for a single error message, rather than
	running "make -k" one single time and grepping its output for
	all the expected error messages.  This should work around make
	implementations with limited (broken?) `-k' support; for more
	information, see these subthreads on the automake-patches list:
	  - 2010-11-15, "Testsuite failures on HP-UX 11.23",

2010-11-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix spurious failures in `silent*.test' for $CC != gcc
	In some tests on automake-produced silent rules, we forced the
	use of gcc depmode to improve testsuite coverage; but this has
	unsurprisingly led to spurious failures when some non-GNU C
	compilers were used.  So we are now careful to require GCC in
	tests that force gcc depmode.
	From reports by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* tests/silent5.test: Test removed, its content split into ...

	Fix regression in colon{5,6}.test (failures on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/colon5.test: Also substitute `@SHELL@' with `$SHELL' when
	post-processing the generated Makefile.in, to work around a bug

	not supported by the AIX 5.3 make implementation.
	This bug has been lurking for a long time, and was activated by
	commit v1.11-125-gc1f6cdb "Enable `errexit' shell flag in various

	* tests/.gitignore: Update.

	Tests defs: $testsbuilddir is now AC_SUBST'ed.
	* tests/defs.in ($testsbuilddir): Substitute from @abs_builddir@.
	Add sanity check on $testsbuilddir, similar to those on
	$testsrcdir and $top_testsrcdir.

	Tests defs: do not print message "Running test $0" anymore.
	* tests/defs.in: Printing the message "=== Running test $0" at
	the beginning of each tests made sense when Automake used the old
	test-driver, which sent all the output directly to stdout/stderr.
	Now that the parallel test-driver is used, which saves output of
	each test in its corresponding log file, that old message is just
	useless noise.

	Tests defs: rename $curdir -> $testbuilddir
	* tests/defs.in: Rename $curdir to $testbuildir, for clarity and
	consistency with $testsrcdir and $top_testsrcdir.

	Tests defs: prefer "$curdir" over "`pwd`".
	* tests/defs.in: We already save the value of `pwd` in $curdir
	early in the file, so there no need to recalculate it later, when
	the current working directory is not changed.

	Tests defs: use `$me' in more error messages.
	* tests/defs.in: Also use `$me' in error messages referring to
	missing `defs' or `defs.in', since that variable is now defined
	before those checks.

	Tests defs: do not use `Exit' where plain `exit' suffices.
	* tests/defs.in: Use "exit 77" rather than "Exit 77" to skip the
	test when required libtool/gettext macros are not found, since
	such skips would take place before the exit trap is installed.

	Tests defs: improve and extends comments.
	* tests/defs.in: Improve and extends some comments, especially in
	relation with the changes introduced by the previous reordering.

	Tests defs: various reorderings.
	* tests/defs.in: Reordered various snippets of code in a
	clearer way.

2010-11-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix bug in test `backcompat4.test' (stale autom4te cache).
	* tests/backcompat4.test: Remove stale autom4te cache directory
	before re-running aclocal and automake.  Also, since we are at
	it, be more verbose in displaying contents of generated files,
	to ease debuggability.
	Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix a bug in variable concatenation with `+='.
	* lib/Automake/VarDef.pm (append): Since the content of the
	"appended-to" variable is going to be unconditionally normalized
	later, simply separate the appended value with a single whitespace
	character, instead of trying to be uselessly smarter by using
	escaped newlines.  This fixes a bug in which extra backslashes
	where erroneously inserted in the variable's final value.
	* tests/pluseq11.test: New test, exposing the bug.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.
	Reported by Andy Wingo.

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Modernize, improve and/or tweak various test scripts.
	* tests/stamph2.test: Improve m4 quoting in `configure.in', and
	prefer trailing `:' over trailing `Exit 0'.
	* tests/syntax.test: Escape literal dots in grep regexps.
	* tests/copy.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Extend test by
	checking with `test' utility that the script `install-sh' is
	copied, but not symlinked.
	* tests/depdist.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Avoid obsoleted
	constructs in generated `configure.in'.  Prefer to do our checks
	by running configure and make over grepping Makefile.in.
	* tests/target-cflags: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag
	earlier in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs). Use the
	`configure.in' stub created by `./defs', rather than writing it
	from scratch.
	* tests/target-clash: Do not uselessly run autoconf.
	* tests/ctarget1.test: Renamed ...
	* tests/cond-basic.test: ... to this.  Use the `configure.in' stub
	created by `./defs', rather than writing it from scratch.
	Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier in the script (just
	after inclusion of ./defs).  Other minor cosmetic changes.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

2010-11-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	New tests on obsoleted usages of automake/autoconf macros (such
	as AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and AC_OUTPUT).
	* tests/backcompat.test: New test script.
	* tests/backcompat2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat6.test: Likewise.
	* tests/init.test: Extended and improved, esp. by trying more
	combinations of calls to AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE with few
	arguments.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

2010-11-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix bug in rules for creating vala vapi/header files.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Add forgotten "fi" in an
	if control structure in a generated make rules.  Bug introduced
	by previous commit `v1.11-221-gd7c1679', and revealed by failure
	of test `vala2.test'.

2010-11-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix and document rules to not touch the tree with `make -n'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Multiple Outputs): Document the problem of
	modifications during dry-run execution, propose solution.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Split recipe so the
	stamp file is not removed with GNU `make -n'.
	(lang_yacc_target_hook): Separate removal of parser output file
	and header remaking.
	* lib/am/lisp.am ($(am__ELCFILES)): Determine whether -n was
	passed to make, take care not to remove any files in that case.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am (%CONFIG_H%): Separate removal of
	%STAMP% file from induced remaking of config header.
	* tests/autohdrdry.test, tests/lispdry.test, tests/yaccdry.test:
	New tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2010-11-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix potential bug in generated tests `instpc-*.test'.
	This bug is due to the changes introduced by the recently-merged
	"tests-init" branch.  In that branch, `tests/defs' didn't define
	anymore `$srcdir', instead defining directly `$testsrcdir'; but
	the generated tests were using `$srcdir', hence the bug.
	Luckily, since the Automake parallel test driver automatically
	exports `srcdir' to a proper value, that prevented the bug from
	manifesting itself.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(instspc_tests)): In the generated test
	scripts, use `$testsrcdir', not `$srcdir'.

2010-11-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Overhauled and modularized tests in `instspc.test'.
	The test `instspc.test' was way too big and fragile.  Its running
	time was very long.  It also produced a log that was nearly
	unreadable due to its length, making it very difficult to find
	out the reason for failures.
	Also, it was too much monolithic, with a single (maybe spurious)
	failure in a corner case causing the whole test to fail (even if
	everything worked as expected in the other 99% of cases).
	The present change should solve these problems, by separating
	`instspc.test' into many smaller, self-contained, auto-generated
	tests.
	* tests/instspc.test: Removed.
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh: New script, fulfilling a double role:
	1. it generates a Makefile.am snippet `tests/instspc-tests.am',
	containing the definition of a list of new tests which will take
	over the older `instspc.test', and
	2. it is sourced by said generated tests with proper parameters
	pre-set, to run the "meat" of the checks.
	This apparent abuse is indeed required because the test generation
	code and test execution code are inevitably intertwined.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/instspc-tests.am): Include this
	snippet, which (among the other things) defines ...
	(instspc_tests): ... this new macro, containing the list of the
	newly generated `instspc*.test' tests, and ...
	(instspc_xfail_tests): ... this new macro, containing the list
	of the `instspc*.test' tests expected to fail.
	($(instspc_tests)): New rule, generates the `instspc*.test' tests.
	($(instspc_tests:.test=.log)): New rule, registers the dependency
	of all `instspc*.test' tests on the `instspc-tests.sh' script.
	(TESTS): Add `$(instspc_tests)', remove `instspc.test'.
	(XFAIL_TESTS): Add `$(xfail_instspc_tests)'.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute instspc-tests.sh.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Added $(instspc_tests).
	Other minor cosmetic changes.
	* bootstrap: Generate instspc-tests.am.
	* tests/.gitignore: Updated.

2010-11-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Add FAQ entry for bug reporting instructions.
	* doc/automake.texi (Reporting Bugs): New section.
	(Introduction): Refer to it.

2010-10-07  Peter Rosin  <peda@lysator.liu.se>

	depcomp: add new one-pass depmode for MSVC 7 and later.
	* lib/depcomp: Add new depmodes 'msvc7' and 'msvc7msys' which
	make use of the -showIncludes option added in MSVC 7.
	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): Handle the new depmodes
	similarly to 'msvisualcpp' and 'msvcmsys' as MSVC does not
	support the -o option.

2010-10-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Add support for newer python versions.
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Add python2.7 and python3.2 to
	_AM_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_LIST.  Since we are at it, break a long
	line and fix indentation.
	* THANKS: Updated.
	From a report by Thomas Klausner.

	Add test for `AM_WITH_DMALLOC' macro.
	* tests/dmalloc.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

	Fix nits and bugs in tests `help*.test'.
	* tests/help4.test: Fix broken sed commands used to strip `-W...'
	flags away from "$AUTOMAKE" and "$ACLOCAL".
	* tests/help3.test: Likewise, and fix a botched comment.
	* tests/help.test: Likewise.  Also, use "AUTOMAKE_fails ..."
	instead of "$AUTOMAKE ... && Exit 1", for consistency and to
	please maintainer-check.
	* tests/help2.test: Likewise.

2010-10-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Improve tests `help*.test' (also fixes maintcheck failures).
	* tests/help.test: To run automake, use `$AUTOMAKE' with all `-W'
	flags stripped away rather than hard-coded `automake-$APIVERSION',
	to better honour user-overrides.  Similarly for aclocal.
	* tests/help2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/help3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/help4.test: Likewise.

2010-10-03  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	tests: fix ar-lib.test for echo that interprets backslashes.
	* tests/ar-lib.test: Use printf instead of echo.  Avoid test -a.
	More robust quoting.

2010-10-03  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	maintainer-check coverage for variables before rules.
	* Makefile.am (sc_ensure_testsuite_has_run): Suggest keeping
	around the test directories.
	(sc_tests_makefile_variable_order): New rule with a heuristic to
	catch ordering violations.

	Document and fix expansion of variables before rules.
	* doc/automake.texi (General Operation): Document that variables
	are expanded before rules.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__check_post): Reword a bit so it does not
	get matched as a rule.
	Suggestion by Ben Pfaff.

2010-10-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Coverage and minor fixes for variable typo detection.

	(handle_ltlibraries): Mark EXTRA_*_DEPENDENCIES as recognized.
	* doc/automake.texi (Linking, Program and Library Variables)
	(LIBOBJS): Document EXTRA_*_DEPENDENCIES.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Suggested by Eric Blake.

	tests: avoid running into timing issues due to sanity change.
	* tests/acloca10.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal9.test:
	Insert strategic sleep before aclocal reruns, to ensure files
	are newer.
	* tests/python11.test: Use --force for repeated autotools runs.
	Reports from the NixOS Hydra build daemon via Ludovic Courtès.

	Fix timestamp issues by ensuring configure takes at least a second.
	* m4/sanity.m4 (AM_SANITY_CHECK): If we didn't sleep here,
	start a sleep in the background and wait for it to finish
	before creating config.status, hopefully fixing all spurious
	testsuite failures involving botched time stamps.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Reports by Ludovic Courtès, Peter Breitenlohner, and others.

2010-10-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Revert "parallel-tests: avoid command-line length limit issue."
	This reverts commit 24e3b4ee2f8cb9f72dd94a05a893f3d4e88b7835,
	because it re-opened the bug fixed by v1.11-10-g218e678.

	2010-09-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: avoid command-line length limit issue.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): New argument $makefile, new
	substitution %MAKEFILE%.
	(generate_makefile): Adjust.
	* lib/am/check.am [%?PARALLEL_TESTS%] (check-TESTS): Pass
	sanitized TEST_LOGS value as makefile snippet on standard
	input to $(MAKE), to avoid exceeding the command line limit on
	w32 (MSYS).
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bob Friesenhahn.

2010-09-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend tests on `--help' and `--version' options.
	* tests/help.test: Create a new empty directory and chdir into
	it, rather than removing already present files.  Run the aclocal
	and automake wrapper scripts directly, instead of relying on
	$AUTOMAKE and $ACLOCAL.  Be sure to correctly match literal dots
	in aclocal's and automake's stderr.  Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/help2.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' works in directories with broken `configure.in'.
	* tests/help3.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' take precedence on the other options.
	* tests/help4.test: New test, checking that the first among the
	`--help' and `--version' options to be specified on the command
	line wins.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

2010-09-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Testsuite: Use `$PATH_SEPARATOR', not `:', when extending PATH.
	* tests/compile2.test: Do no uselessly (implicitly) repeat the
	computation of PATH_SEPARATOR again.
	* tests/instmany-mans.test: Use `$PATH_SEPARATOR', not `:', when
	extending/redefining PATH.
	* tests/instmany-python.test: Likewise.

	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Updated.
	* Makefile.am (sc_tests_PATH_SEPARATOR): New maintainer check.
	(syntax_check_rules): Updated.

	Testsuite: new variables `$PATH_SEPARATOR' and `$APIVERSION'.

	($ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE): Use it.
	($PATH_SEPARATOR):  New AC_SUBST'd variables.
	($PATH): Use it.

2010-09-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Manual: be more agnostic w.r.t. version control system used.
	* doc/automake.texi (Basics of Distribution): Also refer to `.svn'
	directories as a type of probably-unwanted files that are copied
	regardless when adding directories to EXTRA_DIST.
	(The dist Hook): Show a dist-hook example which removes Subversion
	`.svn' private directories from distdir, rather than CVS private
	directories.
	(missing and AM_MAINTAINER_MODE): Try to be more agnostic w.r.t.
	the version control system used.

	Manual: index refer to target "git-dist", not "cvs-dist".
	* doc/automake.texi (General Operation): Index the non-standard
	example about "git-dist" under the "git-dist" label, not under
	the "cvs-dist" one.

	Perl modules: remove references to "Automake CVS repository".
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Update comments to refer to "Automke's
	git repository" rather than to "Automake's CVS repository".
	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Version.pm (=head1 DESCRIPTION): Refer to "git
	branches" rather than "CVS branches".

	Remove obsolete .cvsignore files.
	* .cvsignore, doc/.cvsignore, lib/.cvsignore, lib/am/.cvsignore,
	lib/Automake/.cvsignore, lib/Automake/tests/.cvsignore,
	m4/.cvsignore, tests/.cvsignore: Files deleted.  Even when using
	savannah's CVS readonly mirror there's no way to commit back to
	the real repository, so this files are not worth maintaining or
	keeping around.

2010-09-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* m4/dmalloc.m4: Bump serial number and copyright years.

2010-09-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix broken link in `AM_WITH_DMALLOC' help screen.
	* m4/dmalloc.m4 (AM_WITH_DMALLOC): Refer only to the dmalloc site
	`http://www.dmalloc.com', not to the dmalloc tarball there (which
	seems to have been removed, substituted by multiple release
	tarballs now).

2010-09-21  Peter Rosin  <peda@lysator.liu.se>

	compile: implement library search to support MSVC static linking
	* lib/compile (func_cl_wrapper): Implement library search and
	-static option so that the user can select whether to prefer
	dll import libraries or static libraries.  This enables MSVC to
	link against dlls generated by libtool without requiring libtool
	or workarounds such as -lfoo.dll etc.  Makes the tests/static.at
	test case in libtool pass.
	* tests/compile3.test: Don't trip up if there happens to exist
	a "foo" library in the library search path.
	* tests/compile6.test: New test, verifying the library search.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2010-09-17  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2010-09-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* tests/README: Don't put GCS mandated tools in $required.

2010-09-13  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* HACKING: Hint at old commits with `git describe' output.

2010-09-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Prefer `$(am__cd)' to plain `cd' in our Makefiles.
	* Makefile.am (recheck, dist-hook, git-dist, path-check, fetch)
	(release-stats): Use `$(am__cd)' rather than plain `cd'.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/parallel-tests.am): Likewise.

2010-09-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix regression in test `colon4.test'.
	* tests/colon4.test: Fix botched editing to `configure.in'
	that made the test useless.  Since we are at it, improve
	comments and make grepping of generated Makefile.in slightly
	stricter.
	Regression introduced by change "Modernize, improve and/or
	extend tests `colon*.test" (Stefano Lattarini, 2010-08-08).

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Do not require "gzip" explicitly in tests.
	The gzip utility is simply expected to be present on any decent
	target system for Automake.  So it's pointless to put it in
	$required.
	* tests/install2.test ($required): Do not require "gzip".
	* tests/lex3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/pr9.test: Likewise.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-09-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Use AS_HELP_STRING in AM_SILENT_RULES.
	* m4/silent.m4 (AM_SILENT_RULES): Use `AS_HELP_STRING' to format
	help message regarding configure options `--enable-silent-rules'
	and `--disable-silent-rules'.  Also throw in a couple of cosmetic
	changes in the related `case' statement (indentation, balancing
	of parentheses).
	* THANKS: Update.
	From a report by Jeff A. Daily.

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make some `confh*.test' tests more "semantic" (plus tweakings).
	* tests/confh.test: Run "autoconf", "configure" and "make check",
	instead of munging/grepping the generated `Makefile.in'.
	* tests/confh4.test: Relax the grepping of Makefile.in w.r.t.
	white spaces.  Do not create useless dummy source file `foo.c'
	and useless dummy header file `acconfig.h'.
	(configure.in): Remove superfluous call to `AC_OUTPUT'.
	* tests/confh6.test: Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/confh7.test: In comments, add reference to ...
	* tests/confh8.test: ... this new test, "semantic" sister
	of `confh7.test'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.
	Prompted by a report from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Remove useless whitespace padding in XFAIL_TESTS definition.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove whitespace padding.

2010-09-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: avoid command-line length limit issue.

	substitution %MAKEFILE%.
	(generate_makefile): Adjust.
	* lib/am/check.am [%?PARALLEL_TESTS%] (check-TESTS): Pass

	input to $(MAKE), to avoid exceeding the command line limit on
	w32 (MSYS).
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bob Friesenhahn.

	Posix 2008 requires make to set errexit.
	* lib/am/check.am: Update comment.

2010-09-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Tests defs: remove variable $testaclocaldir.
	* tests/defs.in ($testaclocaldir): Removed.

	autoconf/automake macros.

	Modernize and improve test scripts `dist*.test'.
	* tests/distcleancheck.test: Do not add useless `-e' option to
	a $MAKE call.  Extend test by grepping stderr of make.

	script in subroutine `extract_distcommon'.
	* tests/distcom7.test: Prefer cat + here-doc over echo to write

	* tests/distname.test: Prefer `gzip -d' over `gunzip'.  Move the
	call to `set -e' earlier.  Be stricter and more verbose in the
	checking of the generated tarball.

	* tests/distlinks.test: Likewise.

2010-07-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve and extend test cond5.test.
	* tests/cond5.test: Do not blindly sleep 60 seconds before polling
	the background automake process, but poll it every 10 seconds for
	at most 30 times (this makes the test both faster on good machines,
	and more resilient to spurious timeout-due failures when in low
	priority or on heavily-loaded systems).
	Check also that automake writes the expected error messages on the
	standard error.
	Enable `errexit' flag, and related changes.
	Rely on the `configure.in' stub created by `./defs', rather than
	writing one from scratch.

	precedence over automake (AM_LFLAGS) and (foo_LFLAGS).  Still
	xfailing.
	* tests/lflags2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/yflags.test: New test, check that user $(YFLAGS) takes

	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Use a more
	idiomatic way to count text occurrences in Makefile.in with

	Rewrite manual to be gender-neutral.
	* doc/automake.texi (GNU Build System)
	(Standard Directory Variables, General Operation, CVS)

	* tests/silent3.test: Likewise, and add a final `make distclean'
	command to keep it better in sync with tests/silent{4,9}.test.

	Improved test silent5.test.
	* tests/silent5.test: Remove by hand all generated C files after
	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without
	removing generated sources in between, to check that this does
	not trigger a different set of rules.  Make grepping of make's
	output stricter.  Improved/added some comments.

	* tests/silentf77.test: New test.
	* tests/silentf90.test: Likewise.

	Extend test on `nostdinc' automake option.
	* tests/nostdinc.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Related and
	unrelated minor changes.  Make the grepping of the generated
	Makefile.in slightly stricter.  Generate and run configure, so that
	the generated Makefile can be grepped too.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Make gnupload portable to EBCDIC hosts.
	* lib/gnupload: Use literal newline as argument for 'tr' rather
	than \015, for EBCDIC hosts.  Also, avoid unportable nested
	double-quotes and backquotes.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report from Eric Blake and Steve Goetze via gnulib.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix Autoconf version required by Automake's configure.
	Automake configure script used to tell that automake required
	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.
	* configure.ac ($required_autoconf_version): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/automake.texi (Wildcards): Document portability issue.
	* tests/extra10.test, tests/extra11.test, tests/extra12.test:
	Require GNU make.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Avoid possible false negatives in dejagnu7.test.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Also, avoid
	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	Fix conflnk3.test to work with Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Warning and error message formatting cleanups.
	* aclocal.in (parse_arguments, main): Remove trailing period or

2010-04-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements in comments of test `silent3.test'.
	* tests/silent3.test: Tell to keep it in sync with `silent9.test'
	too.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: ensure verbose printing of captured output.
	* tests/acloca14.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal.test,
	tests/fort2.test, tests/help.test, tests/missing3.test,
	tests/missing6.test: Print captured stdout or stderr before
	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor tests on Automake TESTS color output.
	* tests/color.test: Tests using the expect program moved out to...
	* tests/color2.test: ... this new file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Extended accordingly.

2010-04-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Ensure we don't print 'warning:' or 'error:' twice.
	* Makefile.am (sc_ensure_testsuite_has_run): New helper rule.
	(sc_tests_logs_duplicate_prefixes): New rule, to check for
	wrong-looking warning and error messages in the test suite logs.
	* aclocal.in (scan_configure_dep, scan_file): Remove duplicate
	`warning: ' prefix.
	* tests/vars3.test: Rename variable to avoid false positive.

	Prepend type to warning, error, and fatal messages.
	For the first part of messages of types `error' or `fatal',
	prepend `error: ' to the message.  Prepend `warning: ' to
	warning messages, whatever the setting of -Werror.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (partial): Move up definition.
	(_format_message): Emit `header' and `footer' strings only with
	the first resp. last part of a set of partial messages.

	end of the module.
	(Automake::ChannelDefs): Setup warning channels with header
	`warning: ', error and fatal messages with header `error: '.
	* tests/condinc2.test, tests/ltinstloc.test: Adjust expected
	error messages.
	* tests/comment5.test: Likewise.  Also, include stack notes
	should not start with `error:'.
	* tests/location.test: Likewise.  Also, try both -Werror and
	-Wno-error.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bruno Haible.

	Fix capitalization of error messages, reword one message.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define): Do not capitalize the first
	word in the error message.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Likewise.  Also, reword
	and line-wrap for better readability.

	Adjust tests.

	Fix connected warnings about obsolete exeext override.
	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (define): Merge two warnings that belong
	together, by setting the 'partial' flag for the first one.

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid possible false negatives in cond46.test.
	* tests/cond46.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag (and bumped
	copyright years).  Due to this change, the testcase should now
	fail on unexpected failures in calls to $ACLOCAL/$AUTOMAKE (whose
	outcomes were previously unchecked), and on failures in grepping
	the expected diagnostic in Automake stderr.

2010-04-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Generated tests are now just a thin layer around other tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Rewrite the rule to generate the `*-p.test'
	test scripts so that any of them simply includes the corresponding
	`*.test' script (after setting `$parallel_tests' to `yes').
	* tests/.gitignore: Add wildcard for temporary files used in the
	generation of `*-p.test' tests.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	GNU hello uses fdl.texi, not gpl.texi.
	* doc/automake.texi (Texinfo): Adjust example to upstream
	change.

2010-03-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell
	variable `parallel_tests' is set to `yes'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (defs-p): Target removed.
	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix exit status of signal handlers in shell scripts.
	The value of `$?' on entrance to signal handlers in shell scripts
	cannot be relied upon, so set the exit code explicitly to
	128 + SIG<SIGNAL>.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__check_pre): Use `exit 143' in signal handler.
	* lib/elisp-comp: Likewise.

2010-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix silent-rules output for disabled dependency tracking.
	* lib/am/depend2.am [!%FASTDEP%]: Rework silent-rules variable
	expansion code to also work in the case where %AMDEP% expands
	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to
	set %VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* m4/depend.m4: Substitute am__nodep as '_no', so the second
