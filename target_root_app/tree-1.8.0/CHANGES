Version 1.8.0 (11/16/2018)
  - Added an experimental --fromfile option (suggested by several people.)
    This may eventually be replaced or supplimented by a --fromjson option.
  - Added support for BSD's CLICOLOR and CLICOLOR_FORCE environment variables.
    (Suggested by Alyssa Ross)
  - Use strftime() exclusively when formatting date/time to respect locale.
  - Some man page fixes and cleanups curtsey of Kirill Kolyshkin
  - Update BINDIR in Makefile for MacOS X -- It is not allowed to install
    programs to /usr/bin on MacOS X any longer due to System Integrity
    Protection (SIP) (Shawn Mehan)
  - Misc patches from Jacob Wahlgren:
    - Improved command line switch error reporting.
    - Symbolic links not displayed if a -P pattern is active
    - Missing argument error reporting fixes on long format switches.
  - Fixed JSON output hanging commas (John Lane, Tad, others)
  - JSON size output ignored -h/--si flags (Wagner Camarao)
  - Fixed issue with malformed multibyte string handling. (Mantas
    Mikul&#279;nas)
  - Fixed issue where mbstowcs() fails to null terminate the string due to
    improper UTF-8 encoding leading to garbage being printed. (Nick Craig-Wood)
  - Found a bug where the wrong inode (and device) information would be printed
    for symbolic links. (Stephan Gabert)

Version 1.7.0 (04/23/2014)
  - Allow user/group names up to 32 characters before clipping.
  - Made -i compress XML and JSON output as much as possible by eliminating
    extraneous whitespace.
  - Added --caseinsensitive (renamed --ignore-case ala grep) flag so patterns
    match without regard to case, courtesy of Jason A Donenfeld.
  - Added --matchdirs option courtesy of Brian Mattern & Jason A. Donenfeld
    <Jason@zx2c4.com>.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow on large uid/gids w/o user names/group
    names (Alexandre Wendling <alexandrerw@celepar.pr.gov.br>)
  - Added JSON support courtesy of Florian Sesser <fs@it-agenten.com>.
  - Fixed formatting error with HTML output when -L 1 specified. (Sascha Zorn 
    <sascha.zorn@gmail.com>)
  - Added file size sorting (Philipp M?ller <philippausmuensing@googlemail.com>)
  - Added '--sort[=]<name>' option, ala ls.
  - Fixed OS X makefile problems (Ryan Hollis <theryanhollis@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed possible memory overflow in read_dir (path/lbuf not equal in size
    to pathsize/lbufsize.) (Han Hui <hanhui03@163.com>)
  - Fix S_ISDOOR/S_IFDOOR spelling mistake for Solaris. (Tim Mooney
    <Tim.Mooney@ndsu.edu>)
  - Make tree more reliably detect UTF-8 locales. (Mantas Mikulnas
    <grawity@gmail.com> and others.)
  - Return non-zero exit status on option errors, print usage to stdout when
    not an error, add the posix '--' option terminator, Change -S description
    to mean CP437 (console) output codes, not ASCII. (Ivan Shmakov
    <oneingray@gmail.com>)

Version 1.6.0 (05/24/11)
  - Re-org of code into multiple files, split HTML and Unix listdir() into
    separate functions, various code cleanups and optimizations.
  - Fixed a memory leak in listdir() when memory was allocated early and not
    freed before function exit.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow where symbolic links are followed.
  - Fixed links printing "argetm" before the name of the link when the LINK
    setting for DIR_COLORS is set to target (Markus Schnalke
    <meillo@marmaro.de>)
  - More fully support dir colors -- added support for su, sg, tw, ow, & st
    options (and "do" in theory).
  - Use the environment variable "TREE_COLORS" instead of "LS_COLORS" for
    color information if it exists.
  - Added --si flag to print filesizes in SI (powers of 1000) units (Ulrich
    Eckhardt)
  - Added -Q to quote filenames in double quotes.  Does not override -N or -q.
  - Control characters are no longer printed in carrot notation, but as
    backslashed octal, ala ls, except for codes 7-13 which are printed as
    \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f and \r respectively. Spaces and backslashes are
    also now backslashed as per ls, for better input to scripts unless -Q
    is in use (where "'s are backslashed.) (Ujjwal Kumar)
  - Added -U for unsorted listings (directory order).
  - Added -c for sorting by last status change (ala ls -c).
  - --dirsfirst is now a meta-sort and does not override -c, -v, -r or -t, but
    is disabled by -U.
  - After many requests, added the ability to process the entire tree before
    emitting output.  Used for the new options --du, which works like the du
    command: sums the amount of space under each directory and prints a total
    amount used in the report and the --prune option which will prune all empty
    directories from the output (makes the -P option output much more readable.)
    It should be noted that this will be slow to output when processing large
    directory trees and can consume copious amounts of memory, use at your own
    peril.
  - Added -X option to emit the directory tree in XML format (turns colorization
    off always.)
  - Added --timefmt option to specify the format of time display (implies -D).
    Uses the strftime format.

Version 1.5.3 (11/24/09)
  - Properly quote directories for the system command when tree is relaunched
    using the -R option.
  - Fixed possible indentation problem if dirs[*] is not properly zeroed
    (Martin Nagy).
  - Use strcoll() instead of strcmp() to sort files based on locale if set.
  - Change "const static" to "static const" to remove some compiler warnings
    for Solaris (Kamaraju Kusumanchi).
  - Actually use TREE_CHARSET if it's defined.
  - Automatically select UTF-8 charset if TREE_CHARSET is not set, and the
    locale is set to *UTF-8 (overridden with --charset option.)

Version 1.5.2.2 (01/22/09)
  - Set locale before checking MB_CUR_MAX.
  - Added HP-NonStop platform support (Craig McDaniel <craigmcd@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed to support 32 bit UID/GIDs.
  - Added Solaris build options to Makefile (edit and uncomment to use).

  - Removed several possible overflow problems by dynamically allocating
    arrays in several places.
  - Better support for Locales and printing utf-8 encoded characters in
    filenames (still hackish).
  - Fixed -t to alphasort files with same time-stamps.
  - Fixed encoding of filenames in HTML output, Kyosuke and others.
  - Patches by Kyosuke Tokoro <NBG01720@nifty.ne.jp>:
    - Now, runs OS/2 systems.
      + Print the file attributes in 'adhrs' format for each file, instead
        of the protections in 'drwxrwxrwx' format, when running the tree
        on OS/2 with option -p.
    - Added --charset option, to specify which character set is used for
      output.
       + You can specify any IANA registered character set name. But I have
         tested only following character sets:
               Shift_JIS       EUC-JP          IBM850
               UTF-8           ISO-8859-1      US-ASCII
       + Now, `-S' option is equal to `--charset=IBM437'.
       + When running on OS/2 systems, the default value of this option
         is according to current codepage.  On the other systems, no default.
