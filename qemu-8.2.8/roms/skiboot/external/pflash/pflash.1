pflash \- manual page for Open-Power Flash tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpflash\fP [\fI\,options\/\fP] \fI\,commands\/\fP...
.SH DESCRIPTION
pflash is a tool to access the flash modules
on such systems and update the OpenPower firmware.
.SS Options
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fI\,address\/\fP, \fB\-\-address\fP=\fI\,address\/\fP
Specify the start address for erasing, reading or flashing
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fI\,size\/\fP, \fB\-\-size\fP=\fI\,size\/\fP
Specify the size in bytes for erasing, reading or flashing
.TP
\fB\-P\fP \fI\,part_name\/\fP, \fB\-\-partition\fP=\fI\,part_name\/\fP
Specify the partition whose content is to be erased
programmed or read. This is an alternative to \fB\-a\fP and \fB\-s\fP
if both \fB\-P\fP and \fB\-s\fP are specified, the smallest of the
two will be used
.TP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP
Don't ask for confirmation before erasing or flashing
.TP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dummy\fP
Don't write to flash
.TP
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-mtd\fP
Avoid accessing the flash directly if the BMC supports it.
This will access the flash through the kernel MTD layer and
not the flash directly
.TP
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bmc\fP
Target BMC flash instead of host flash.
Note: This carries a high chance of bricking your BMC if you
don't know what you're doing. Consider \fB\-\-mtd\fP to be safe(r)
.TP
\fB\-F\fP \fI\,filename\/\fP, \fB\-\-flash\-file\fP \fI\,filename
Target filename instead of actual flash.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-side\fP
Side of the flash on which to operate, 0 (default) or 1
.TP
\fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-toc\fP
libffs TOC on which to operate, defaults to 0.
leading 0x is required for interpretation of a hex value
.SS
Commands:
.TP
\fB\-4\fP, \fB\-\-enable\-4B\fP
Switch the flash and controller to 4\-bytes address
mode (no confirmation needed).
.TP
\fB\-3\fP, \fB\-\-disable\-4B\fP
Switch the flash and controller to 3\-bytes address
mode (no confirmation needed).
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fI\,file\/\fP, \fB\-\-read\fP=\fI\,file\/\fP
Read flash content from address into file, use \fB\-s\fP
to specify the size to read (or it will use the source
file size if used in conjunction with \fB\-p\fP and \fB\-s\fP is not
specified). When using \fB\-r\fP together with \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-p\fP, the
read will be performed first
.TP
\fB\-E\fP, \fB\-\-erase\-all\fP
Erase entire flash chip (Not supported on all chips/controllers)
.TP
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-erase\fP
Erase the specified region. If size or address are not
specified, but '\-\-program' is used, then the file
size will be used (rounded to an erase block) and the
address defaults to 0.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fI\,file\/\fP, \fB\-\-program\fP=\fI\,file\/\fP
Will program the file to flash. If the address is not
specified, it will use 0. If the size is not specified
it will use the file size. Otherwise it will limit to
the specified size (whatever is smaller). If used in
conjunction with any erase command, the erase will
take place first.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-tune\fP
Just tune the flash controller & access size
(Implicit for all other operations)
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fB\-\-clear\fP
Used to ECC clear a partition of the flash
Must be used in conjunction with \fB\-P\fP. Will erase the
partition and then set all the ECC bits as they should be
.TP
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-info\fP
Display some information about the flash.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
This message.
