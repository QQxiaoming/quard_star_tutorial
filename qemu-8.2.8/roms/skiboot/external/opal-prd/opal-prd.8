.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBopal-prd\fP is a daemon that listens for hardware diagnostic events (by
listening on the \fI/dev/opal-prd\fP device), and executes firmware-provided
executable code to handle these events. Only one instance of the daemon
can be running at a time.

.PP
If no arguments are provided, or the \fIdaemon\fP command is used, then
the PRD daemon will be started and will listen for incoming hardware events.
Generally, this will be run from init as a background service, and not
be run as a user or with user interaction.

.PP
\fIopal-prd\fP will log to syslog, using the LOG_DAEMON facility. Messages will
use the string "opal-prd" for their syslog ident.

.PP
For debugging, run the daemon with the \fI--debug\fP and \fI--stdio\fP
options. This will log to stdout (instead of syslog), and enable extra
debugging information.

.PP
A running opal-prd daemon will also listen for control messages from
the user; these are sent using the same \fIopal-prd\fP executable, run
with the <command> argument:

.RS
 opal-prd <command> [arguments]
.RE

.PP
Note that the daemon must be running in the background here, as a separate
process.

.PP
Currently, there's one command available, 'occ', for controlling the
on-chip-controllers. That has 3 possible sub-commands: \fIreset\fP,
\fIenable\fP, and \fIdisable\fP.
