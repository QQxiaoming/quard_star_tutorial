.SH NAME
imaextend \- Runs TPM2 imaextend
.SH DESCRIPTION
imaextend
.PP
Runs TPM2_PCR_Extend to Extend a SHA\-1 IMA measurement file (binary) into TPM PCRs
The IMA measurement is directly extended into the SHA\-1 bank, and a zero padded
measurement is extended into the SHA\-256 bank
.PP
This handles the case where a zero measurement extends ones into the IMA PCR
.PP
If \fB\-sim\fR is specified, TPM PCRs are not extended.  Rather, imaextend extends into
simluated PCRs and traces the result.
.TP
\fB\-if\fR
IMA event log file name
.TP
[\-le
input file is little endian (default big endian)]
.TP
[\-sim
calculate simulated PCRs]
.TP
[\-b
beginning entry (default 0, beginning of log)]
A beginning entry after the end of the log becomes a noop
.TP
[\-e
ending entry (default end of log)]
E.g., \fB\-b\fR 0 \fB\-e\fR 0 sends one entry
.TP
[\-l
time \- run in a continuous loop, with a sleep of 'time' seconds betwteen loops]
The intent is that this be run without specifying \fB\-b\fR and \fB\-e\fR
Afer each pass, the next beginning entry is set to the last entry +1
